## Our Capitalist System {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/12_1-Capitalism.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

**Refresh my memory, what are we talking about when we say we live under a capitalist system?**

- (Private ownership of the means of production, not public)
    
- (Individuals motivated by the pursuit of profit, and)
    
- (Free markets where prices are set by supply and demand)

<br>

**And, how has living under this system led you to make some sub-optimal environmental choices?**

- **Is it because you hate the environment?**

- *Solicit examples from Canvas assignment two weeks ago*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last week we explored an American environmental catastrophe

## The Dust Bowl (approx 1932-1940) {background-image="Images/12_1-Dust_Bowl_photo.avif"}

::: notes

**According to Worster, how did American "capitalism" create the Dust Bowl?**

- **What were the key assumptions we unpacked and explored?**

<br>

- (**SLIDE**: The argument we examined in class)

:::



## Capitalism and the Dust Bowl {background-image="Images/12_1-Dust_Bowl_photo_v3.png"}

- American culture is capitalist

- Capitalism replaces our national identity with one focused on being an isolated, economically stressed individual (consumer)

- Capitalism teaches us that nature is a resource and our survival is separate from nature's survival

- Capitalism shortens time horizons and creates incentives to ignore science

**Therefore, capitalism caused the Dust Bowl**

::: notes

**Which of our historical perspectives does this look like?**

- (Edenist, right?)

<br>

**Are we convinced by this argument? Why or why not?**

- **Strengths?**

- **Weaknesses?**

<br>

I'll be honest, these are big claims that strike at the heart of our system and I don't want to treat them flippantly

- **SLIDE**: This week we shift our focus to a more recent argument along these lines

::: notes

This week I've assigned you chapters from Peter Dauvergne's book, Environmentalism of the Rich

<br>

Dr. Dauvergne has published EXTENSIVELY in this research area

- A very engaging writer

- I always enjoy reading his stuff (even if it is crushingly depressing)

<br>

The main focus of the book is to encourage us to think critically about environmentalism.

- Where did it come from, what has it accomplished and where is it going?

- But doing that, it also forces us to grapple with the capitalist system we live under

<br>

This week we will explore part 1 of his book that focuses on globabl unsustainability

- Next week we shift to his critiques of environmentalism

<br>

*Split class into small groups (four groups total?)*

- Go sit with your group!

**Therefore, globalization is a modern extension of the destructive imperialism we thought was in our past**

::: notes

Groups, this represents one attempt to summarize the key arguments of these two chapters.

- I want you to fill in the premises of this argument

- What are the big ideas Dauvergne uses to build up to this conclusion?

<br>

My advice:

1. Don't get bogged down in all the evidence; aim for the big ideas

2. Make sure you clearly define and link the concepts in this conclusion in the argument itself

3. Work directly on the board so we can see how the argument is developing and give each other feedback

<br>

Go!

## Chapters 2 and 3 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

- The age of European imperialism devastated the social fabric of developing societies around the world

- The age of European imperialism devastated ecosystems around the world

- In the 20th century the developed world shifted to globalization as its means of extracting profit, extending control and imposing beliefs on the world

- Globalization is frequently as "violent and exploitative" as imperialism

**Therefore, globalization is a modern extension of the destructive imperialism we thought was in our past**

::: notes

**Is everybody clear on what we mean by the concept "imperialism"?**

- [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/imperialism)

- "Imperialism is a form of international hierarchy in which one political community, or polity, effectively governs or controls another political community."

- Researchers tend to refer to classify this "governing or control" as "domination"

    - e.g. "By domination we mean the ability of the dominant polity – the metropole – to decide policy for the subordinate policy – the colony. This ability may entail substantial delegation of decision-making authority to elite members of the colony, but the metropole retains the power to decide what gets delegated and how, and when this authority is revoked."

<br>

**Groups, how susbtantial is the evidence for the first two premises?**

- **What stood out to you in the two chapters for these?**

<br>

Shifting to the latter two premises

- **Is everybody clear on what we mean by the concept "globalization"?**

- IMF: "It refers to the increasing integration of economies around the world, particularly through the movement of goods, services, and capital across borders."

- Peterson Institute for International Economics: Globalization describes the growing interdependence of the world’s economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, and flows of investment, people, and information.

<br>

This makes "globalization" sound very innocuous right?

- **Groups, how susbtantial is the evidence for these two premises?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let me show you some additional data to help us think about this argument

<br>

*Dauvergne Notes Ch2 and Ch3*

Chapter 2

- The argument: For the developing world, globalization is imperialism continued under another name.
- European imperialism serving as the root of modern globalization
- Case study: Captain Quieros and the start of imperial domination in what is now Vanuatu
- Globalization can be every bit as violent and exploitative as imperialism
    - e.g. world powers forcing developing countries to deregulate economic affairs, to open borders to foreign capital and trade
- Current evidence: Massive and rising debt of the developing world; Rising inequality, concentrating financial power


Chapter 3

- The Argument: Europeans brought capitalism into Nauru and once a valuable resource was discovered Nauru destroyed itself.
- Europeans don't stumble onto tiny Nauru until 1798
- By accident, 1899-1901 Phosphate ore is discovered
- By 1968, 1/3 of Naur strip-mined
- After independence, Nauru chose to increase mining despite knowing supplies would shortly run out, exports generated much wealth.
- Desperate to replace income, Nauru becomes haven for dirty banks, money laundering and starts selling off citizenships.
- By the early 2000s supplies plummett and economic catastrophe is wrought.
- At this point, Nauru has allowed Australia to set up a detention camp for would-be immigrants as it needs the money for hosting them.

![](Images/12_1-developing-countries-face-higher-borrowing-costs.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

This is data from UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)

- The rich world draws the developing world into global trade with the promise of development

- HOWEVER, the risks they face are greater, so they are charged a premium "to play" in global markets

<br>

Since 2020, developing countries have been borrowing at average rates two to four times higher than those for the United States, making it harder to invest in sustainable development.

- High interest rates, weak global growth and rising uncertainty are squeezing public budgets. 

- The consequences are direct and devastating, as people – especially vulnerable populations – pay the price.

<br>

For academics like Dauvergne, this suggests that globalization has not been designed primarily to benefit the developing world

- It has been structured to continue our exploitation of it

<br>

**SLIDE**: What do these growing debt burdens mean for the developing world?

![](Images/12_1-UN_Data_Interest_vs_Education_and_Health.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Public debt can be a powerful tool for development. 

- Governments use it to invest in their people and economies – and pave the way to a better future. 

- The promise of globalization was to improve standards of living everywhere, but...

<br>

But when debt grows too large or becomes too costly, it turns into a burden.

- That is the current reality for much of the developing world.

- Today, a total of 3.4 billion people now live in countries that spend more on debt interest than on either health or education.

<br>

Let's now get a better look at Nauru once it stopped being a colony!

- **SLIDE**: This is a particularly important case for our thinking about capitalism and the environment

VIDEO: (12 minutes) Nauru: Environmental Apocalypse in the World’s Smallest Republic ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbMpaJuhHeM))

- 13:43 - 25:29 - Nauru achieves independence and loses its damn mind; nice note of the people protesting but elites keep spending. At 23:55 - This is a warning to us all. Deep sea mining.

<br>

**So, what are the lessons of the Nauru case for us?**

- **Is Dauvergne on to something here about globalization, imperialism and the destruction on the environment?**

<br>

I think the Nauru example really drives home some key elements of Dauvergne's argument here

- It's not just that opening up to global markets damages the environment, BUT

- Framing growth through trade incentivizes you to make even worse choices in the future!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Take it one step further

::: notes

The destruction of Nauru is a tragedy driven by capitalism and short time horizons

<br>

The big question for us is, is the Nauru case a fluke of a tiny island or is this a warning about what we are doing to the entire planet?

- **Do you think the Nauru case is a good analogy for the global environment? Why or why not?**

- "To survive, capitalism needs to expand production and markets" (49)

- Companies work to be cleaner, more efficient and less wasteful THEN reinvest those profits in expansion in order to sell even more stuff

- Too often, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is about protecting wealth and privilege rather than promoting ecological ends

- Those who question this environmentalism of the rich are scorned and derided

**Therefore, you cannot embed environmentalism in the capitalist system and expect ecologically positive outcomes**

<br>

*Dauvergne Notes Ch4*

- The Argument: World politics is defined by the want of more (money, stuff)
- Even companies dedicated to making themselves cleaner, more efficient, less wasteful just reinvest those profits in expansion in order to sell even more stuff.
- Too often, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is about protecting wealth and priviledge rather than promoting ecological ends.
- Those who question this env of the rich are scorned and derided.
- Case: Kalle Lasn, Adbusters and the Occupy Movement 
- Case: Patagonia's $700 "don't buy this jacket" jacket
- The spread of sustainability as a corporate mantra
- Case: Pampers in China; crummy product equalled crummy sales; improved product plus MASSIVE marketing campaign "golden sleep"
- "To survive, capitalism needs to expand production and markets" (49).
- Oil and gas companies provide the literal fuel for this growth and they have succeeded massively as economies have grown.
- The catch? So much of this wealth is being generated only at the very top. Inequality is exploding!
- Argument: wealth inequality is deeply problematic for sustainability.
