::: notes

Talk to me about Nash's "spectrum of environments".

- **How is this an answer to the question, what is the wilderness or nature?**

- **In other words, what is this visualization trying to get us to consider?**

<br>

The wilderness is not a "thing," it is a quality.

- All environments can be placed on a scale from complete human control to the absence of direct human control

<br>

**Why have I been arguing to you that shifting your focus in this way is a big deal?**

- (**SLIDE**: Cronon's argument)

William Cronon is a distinguished historian who has long studied humanity's relationship to nature across time.

- His book *Uncommon Ground* is quite brilliant and we'll read some parts from it later this semester

<br>

I bring him up simply to note an extension of Nash's spectrum

- Cronon very much agrees with Nash that "wilderness‚Äù is a social construct, and he argues that recognizing that fact compels us to act!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Act how? We must stop putting wilderness on a pedestal

### [We must abandon "the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial...and the tree in the wilderness as natural... Both trees in some ultimate sense are wild; both in a practical sense now depend on our management and care" (Cronon 1996, 24).]{style="color:white;"}

::: notes

As someone deeply invested in solving problems in our community I REALLY love this idea

- Fighting about what is or isn't wilderness is a waste of time

<br>

FIRST, that fight has no end

- As we saw, "wilderness" has no fixed definition across cultures, places, government agencies or times

<br>

SECOND, it implies that ONLY the wild lands deserve our protection

- Don't give up your agency before getting to work!

- ALL environments have wild elements and our world is better off when we plan for them

<br>

Bottom line from the Nash perspective, protecting and promoting wilderness is a valuable activity no matter what your current environment looks like!

- We have responsibilities to resource management BOTH in the "wild places" AND where humans live too!

<br>

**Kind of cool, right?**

- I like when the broadly philosophical or historical material lends itself this directly to practical advice for policy-making

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last week we moved from conceptualizing wilderness in broad terms and began exploring our first historical perspective on wilderness

::: notes

Talk to me about the Edenic narrative of wilderness.

- **What were your takeaways about this perspective?**

<br>

- **What was Eden and how did it relate to wilderness?**

- **If the wilderness is the absence of God, per the Bible and the Bradford diary, then what is our duty when we encounter wilderness?**

<br>

Wernick (1965) takes this even further!

- **What was Wernick's argument?**

    - (Spoil the wilderness)
    
- **Strengths and weaknesses of this argument?**

    - (Weaknesses: Too many straw men)
    - (Strengths: Inconsistency in behavior of the wilderness defenders, societal needs are equally important to natural ones)

<br>

**And what was White's (1967) argument?**

- (Modern science and culture in the West dramatically shaped by Christian perspectives on the environment (nature created for man's exploitation) and that has led us to ecological catastrophe)

- **Strengths and weaknesses of this argument?**

    - (Huge generalizations BUT well sourced, well written and plausible)

Your assignment for today was to find us examples of this Edenic narrative in the world around us

1. Arguments for Consumers: Find a product or service

2. Arguments for Citizens: Find an argument or call to action

<br>

**In essence, this exercise is meant to both reinforce our understanding of the first perspective AND to see how far White's argument extends to the modern day!**

<br>

**How did this go?**

<br>

*Split class into groups of four*

- *Five groups of four are what 300 can handle in separate clusters*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start by talking about our lives as consumers!

<br>

Canvas DISCUSSION: The Value of the Wilderness Is Maximized Through Productive Use

Find us two examples of this week's perspective, whether implicitly suggested or explicitly stated, being deployed in our community today (e.g. local, state, national or global). No overlapping cases (first-come, first-served).

1. Arguments for Consumers: Find a product, service or experience for sale that is designed to help us extract the most value from wilderness or nature. Submit: 1) A web link to the product/service/experience, and 2) An explanation of HOW the marketing for this item connects it to the Edenic narratives we explored last class (3+ sentences).

2. Arguments for Citizens: Find an example of someone arguing that we should "open up" or increase our use of a specific wilderness or natural area in order to extract more value from it. Submit: 1) A link to the argument, 2) a brief summary of the argument (2+ sentences), and 3) An explanation of HOW this argument connects it to the Edenic narratives we explored last class (3+ sentences).

### Find a product, service or experience for sale that is designed to help us extract the most value from wilderness or nature

::: {.fragment}
- How pervasive is the Edenic narrative in our consumer lives?
:::

::: notes

Groups, start by focusing on the consumer side of our lives (e.g. Canvas Assignment Q1)

- Take some time to review all the submitted cases and get ready to report back your experience of doing this assignment

- **REVEAL: Specifically, I want you to tell me, how pervasive is the Edenic narrative in the marketing of products and services to American consumers?**

<br>

*REPORT back and DISCUSS*

<br>

### Find a product, service or experience for sale that is designed to help us extract the most value from wilderness or nature

- Which specific messages were most effective on you? Why?

::: notes

Groups, dig back into the cases and get ready to report back

- **Which specific messages work most effectively on you?**

- **In other words, what makes you want to spend some money? Why?**

<br>

*REPORT back and DISCUSS*

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Reflect on this as a class

<br>

### Why is the Edenic narrative so pervasive in our marketplace?

- American consumers are moved by these arguments?

- Companies are motivated to spread these arguments?

::: notes

**CLASS: What do we think explains the pervasiveness of this narrative in our marketing?**

- **Is it that these messages work well on American consumers OR that companies want to push it on us? Or both?**

<br>

*DISCUSS*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's shift to political arguments

:::

<br>

### Find an example of someone arguing that we should "open up" or increase our use of a specific wilderness or natural area in order to extract more value from it

- List 1: Reasons you find compelling

- List 2: Reasons that do not work on you at all

::: notes

Groups, take a few minutes to review the political arguments submitted on Canvas (Q2)

- Reflect on the arguments and build two lists to share with us

- Flag the specific messages that you find most compelling and those that don't work on you at all

- Importantly, you don't have to agree with the conclusion of the argument!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- *ON BOARD*
