## Capitalist Systems {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/12_1-Capitalism.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

**By a "capitalist system," what are we describing?**

- (PRIVATE ownership of the means of production)

<br>

**SLIDE**: To the Dust Bowl

:::



## Did capitalism cause the Dust Bowl? {background-image="Images/12_1-Dust_Bowl_photo.avif"}

::: notes

**According to Worster, what specific mechanisms connect the private ownership of the means of production to ecological catastrophe?**

<br>

- Capitalism teaches you to be a consumer first, an American second

- Capitalism trains consumers to shorten their time horizons and to cherry-pick science for profit

- Capitalism teaches us that nature is a resource FIRST and that we can survive without it

- **Worster puts all this together to argue that capitalism creates ecological catastrophes like the Dust Bowl**

<br>

Everybody reflect on this for a second

- **Does your life as a consumer color all your choices? Why or why not?**

- **How short or long are your personal time horizons when making day-to-day choces?**

- **Do you believe you can survive without nature?**

- **If not, do you make choices that suggest you actually do think that's possible?**

<br>

**So, do you find Worster's argument convincing?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Dauvergne extends the argument

:::



## Dauvergne's Argument {background-image="Images/13_2-Nauru_Mined_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The Exploitative Strategies of Capitalism**

1. Western imperialism

2. Economic Globalization

3. Environmentalism of the Rich
:::

::: notes

In Part 1 of his book, Dauvergne sets out to make this argument: 

- Capitalism created / shaped an environmentalism of the rich that is part of the problem rather than the solution to it

<br>

**What specific pieces of evidence did he provide to make this argument?**

- **Don't draw on the readings for today yet, let's just recap the material from the first 9 chapters!**

<br>

- Globalization is supremely destructive without ever needing to conquer your lands

    - poor, poor Nauru

- Despite our efforts to be more sustainable we are rapidly consuming the earth’s resources and filling the world with poison

    - We feel better about our choices, but our choices still suck

- Modern environmentalism is a creation of the West and is now too responsive only to the West (Chapter 7)

- Capitalism shapes activism and activists to fit into the system and disappears the outliers (Chapter 8)

- Radical environmentalism is necessary but should move forward in non-violence (Chapter 9)

<br>

I'm going to sidestep our discussions from last week about environmental advocacy and eco-terrorism for the moment

- We'll hit those with the last chapter you read for today

<br>

Today I want to explore the final few chapters of Dauvergne's book which aim to finish this critique of environmentalism

- **SLIDE**: Let's start with Chapter 10 "Mindbombing the Wealthy"

:::




## Dauvergne's (2016) Arguments {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### Ch 10: Mindbombing the Wealthy

- Eco-Warriors of the Arctic Sunrise
- Greenpeace International
    - The Barbie-Box Campaign
    - The Palm Oil Campaign
- The Power of Eco-Consumerism

::: notes

**Let's set the proverbial table here, what does Dauvergne mean by "mindbombing"?**

- (1st paragraph of the chapter!)

- Greenpeace cofounder Bob Hunter "liked to call on his comrades to 'mindbomb' global consciousness with media images of environmental wrong-doing"... 

- Targeting "consumers and policy-makers with ideas and images, relying on the daring acts of 'eco-warriors'..., the backing of music and movie stars, and the shaming of iconic brands to capture the world's imagination" (p113). 

<br>

**How aware were you of the "mindbombing" campaigns this chapter talks about?**

- **e.g. Barbie boxes, palm oil, Gazprom protests in the Arctic Sea?**

<br>

**What stood out to you about the cases explored in the chapter?**

- **Are you impressed by these successes? Why or why not?**

- **Are these repeatable strategies for activists today? Why or why not?**

<br>

Let's go find current examples!

- Everybody hit the internet for a minute and go find us examples of green groups active mindbombing campaigns

- *Share and discuss each, you pull them up on the big screen*

<br>

**Ok, big picture, what is the central argument in Chapter 10?**

- "Consumers are the foot soldiers of today's middle class environmentalism" (p123)

    - There is great power in mass protests and 

- BUT our successes in changing business processes has NOT reduced consumption or put us on a safer, more sustainable path

<br>

**How convincing do you find this argument?**

- **Strengths and weaknesses?**
 
<br>

**SLIDE**: On to Chapter 11!

<br>

*Chapter 10 Mindbombing the Wealthy*

- "The power of Greenpeace to influence global supply chains and certification processes would appear to be increasing as multinational brands and local suppliers try to avoid becoming a target. ... But it's easy to exaggerate the value of the resulting corporate reforms... ...mindbombing middle-class consumers over social media is doing little to alter the world politics of ever-rising revenues, growth, and consumption" (114).

- Eco-Warriors of the Arctic Sunrise
    - Protests of Gazprom in the Arctic sea lead to arrests and a worldwide movement to free the protestors. Calls this a successful mindbomb.

- Greenpeace International: Barbie-Box Campaign
    - "Campaigns to discourage consumers from purchasing a product until the manufacturer modifies a particular practice have tended to achieve the most traction. Firms have generally offered the least resistance when it's relatively easy and inexpensive to appease campaigners, and when doing so does not look likely to hurt long-term revenues, profits, or market control, as was the case with the 2011 Greenpeace campaign to push Mattel to change its Barbie doll packaging" (118).

- Greenpeace: Palm Oil Campaign
    - Nestle eventually buckles to the pressure. "Today, the company portrays NGOs as allies, not adversaries. Activists are, in the words of Nestles' Chris Hogg, the company's 'eyes and ears on the ground. And if they find something we take it seriously and look into it' " (120).
    - "Will such efforts slow deforestation? Divisions within rainforest activism run deep over the value of business pledges, CSR and certification, eco-products and eco-tourism, and using forests as carbon sinks" (123).

- The Power of Eco-Consumerism
    - "Consumers are the foot soldiers of today's middle class environmentalism" (123).
    - Is it effective? Much good is being done HOWEVER plastic waste is rising and "Eco-consumerism is also doing a little to reduce global energy consumption" (124).

<br>

### Ch 11: Million Dollar Pandas

- WWF

- Coca-Cola Pandas

- The Rise of Corporate Partnerships

::: notes

Let's talk about the case Dauvergne makes in chapter 11

<br>

Dauvergne argues that corporate partnerships with green NGOs represent the "forefront of the environmentalism of the rich"

- **What are the environmental pros and cons of pursuing these deals?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Corporate money and partnerships with Green NGOS...**
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="48%"}
**The Good**

- Finances green projects, programs, and technologies

- Pays for NGO staff, supplies, buildings, and campaign costs

- Gives NGOs the chance to monitor, and even manage, certification and eco-labeling programs

- Offers NGOs the chance to work alongside business executives and state regulators
:::

::: {.column width="4%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
**The Bad**

- Cedes authority to the businesses as the decision-makers

- Defuses "criticism of the growth, sales, and profit models of multinational investors, manufacturers, and retailers

- Does little to "lighten ecological footprints"

- Does nothing "to reduce the extreme inequalities, unrelenting violence, and unsustainable growth underlying the world economy"
:::
::::


::: notes

**The question for us becomes, do we think this is the "right" approach for advancing environmental goals in a capitalist system? Why or why not?**

- **In other words, do companies gain more from partnering with green NGOs than they give up?**

- *Encourage this discussion*

<br>

Let's look at more recent evidence

- PLAY VIDEO CLIP: (7 mins) Seaspiracy (1hr30) on Netflix: 44:30 - 51:40

- IF ENOUGH TIME PLAY VIDEO CLIP (sets up the scope of the problem): (13 mins) 38:48 - 51:40

- *Arguments criticizing Sierra Club and Oceana for supporting "sustainable fishing" to protect their membership models AND the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) for deriving 80% of its revenue from licensing their logo*

<br>

**What do you think?**

- **Are you convinced that an environmentalism that embraces partnerships is one that cannot achieve the needed ends? Why or why not?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: So, what do we do about it?

<br>

*Chapter 11 Million Dollar Pandas*

- "Corporate money and partnerships are financing environmental projects, programs, and technologies. And they are paying for NGO staff, supplies, buildings, and campaign costs" (127).
- "Such partnerships with business are also offering NGOs the chance to monitor, and even manage, certification and eco-labeling programs. And they're opening up opportunities for environmental activists to advise--or perhaps work alongside--business executives and state regulators" (127).
- "We should not discount the benefits of corporate funding and partnerships for the capacity of environmental NGOs to support programs and projects. ... Yet at the same time such Partnerships, now at the Forefront of environmentalism of the rich, our seating authority to global business by defusing criticism of the growth, sales, and profit models of multinational investors, manufacturers, and retailers. These partnerships... are also doing little to lighten ecological footprints and nothing at all to reduce the extreme inequalities, unrelenting violence, and unsustainable growth underlying the world economy" (128).

WWF

- The World Wildlife Fund as a case study
- 1986 name change to World Wide Fund for Nature
- 2001 to WWF
- WWF has accomplished much through corporate partnerships and labeling, however, Dauvergne argues WWF isn't actually "helping to reduce pollution and wasteful consumption or lower humanity's ecological footprint" (133). See partnership with Coke as an example.
    - Is this a fair critique??
- Other examples: Conservation International, Environmental Defense Fund
- Seems to argue that the businesses gain far more cover for bad behavior than the NGOs gain in funding and incremental improvements to industrial processes.

## Dauvergne's (2016) Ch 12 Arguments {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.incremental}

1. Which of these recommendations would you like to see become policy in our community? Why?

2. Which of these recommendations would you oppose or feel least comfortable with? Why?

3. Which of these recommendations would represent the easiest changes for a community to make and which the hardest? Why?

:::

::: notes

In Chapter 12 Dauvergne makes a series of recommendations for what we must do to to ensure a sustainable earth ("As If Consumption Matters"). 

- I asked each of you to reflect on these in your Canvas submission for today and now we need to talk about them!

<br>

**REVEAL x 3** then *go around the room to share and discuss*

<br>

**SLIDE**: 

<br>

*Chapter 12 Conclusion: The Allure and Illusion of Riches*

- "... Looking globally over the past 50 years, environmentalism in all of its diversity has clearly been an important counterforce to the reckless pursuit of economic growth, corporate profits, and personal consumption" (139).
- "especially since the early 1970s environmentalism has made a real difference in how governments regulate, how corporations operate, and how people live. In this sense environmentalism is succeeding. Yet, even as environmentalism continues to spread, the global environmental crisis continues to escalate. In this sense environmentalism is failing" (140).
- "Still, environmentalists must accept some responsibility for the escalating crisis. Especially since the 1990s, as I've argued in this book, environmentalism has increasingly come to reflect the interests and comforts of those with the most money and the most power. ... After all, in wealthier countries environmentalism emerged from a desire to preserve nature for trail hiking, bird-watching, game hunting, and sustainable yields, then later gain strength following calls to clean up pollution in high-income neighborhoods. Yet in recent years, the priorities of big business, powerful economies, and well-off consumers have taken center stage, while calls for frugality, quality of life, community well-being, social equality, corporate controls, limits on growth, and sustainable consumption have been pushed into the wings" (141).
- Environmentalism of the rich has "considerable power to produce small-scale, local successes." However, it lacks the "capacity to aggregate into global scale solutions or transform the political, economic, and social structures causing over-consumption, extreme and equality, and ecological decay. The growing dominance of environmentalism of the rich moreover is having insidious consequences, weakening the power of environmentalism as a whole to function as a counter narrative and counterforce to consumer capitalism, while opening up opportunities for ruling elites to co-opt aspects of the movement to enhance the legitimacy of business as usual" (141).

The Appeal of Environmentalism of the Rich

- "It exudes optimism in pragmatism and realism, up ceiling to the understandable desire to move beyond pessimism and cynicism... Solutions arise from business Innovation, wealth creation, new technology, eco-markets, free trade, more foreign investment, and faster development, not from new rules to contain excesses and change lifestyles. All that is necessary are small steps and small changes, allowing people to feel like they're advancing sustainability without sacrificing anything of note" (142).

The Limits of Environmentalism of the Rich

- "Those who put their faith in environmentalism of the rich do not account adequately for the sources and consequences of such extreme wealth. Nor did they sufficiently integrate into their analysis the legacies of imperialism, colonialism, and the globalization of consumer capitalism. Moving toward global sustainability will require the rich to confront the violent, unjust, and risky sources of their wealth" (144).
- "Efficiencies are quickly lost as companies reinvest savings to ramp up production and stimulate even greater levels of unsustainable consumption" (145).
- "As we saw, however, states have long treated both environmentalism of the poor and the direct action of radical add activists as security threats, suppressing uprisings and jailing leaders. And challenging the wealth and values of ruling Elites has become even harder since the al-Qaeda attacks of 2001, with countries such as the US now classifying direct action environmentalism as eco-terrorism" (145).
- "In short, environmentalism of the rich is doing little to scale back the global ecological damage of States, corporations, or markets, primarily addressing symptoms of unsustainability, not root causes" (147).

As If Consumption Matters

- "My premise here is in no way surprising, although it is surprising to me how often people across every culture ignore it: careers, choices, and everyday consumption matter greatly for the sustainability of the Earth " (149).
- "...getting people to consume less and differently is crucial for global sustainability" (150).
- "Moving high consuming lifestyles toward a fair earth share will therefore require far-reaching political and economic reforms... Stricter International and domestic laws to protect ecosystems and human rights are necessary. So are measures to end extreme and equality and stop corporate pillaging. So are far higher levels of precaution when introducing new technologies and chemicals. And so is a new energy base for our economies: carbon neutral, with fair distribution. Most challenging of all, we will need more people, especially those with power and money, to accept more responsibility for the consequences of the sources of their wealth, owning up to historical wrongs and to contemporary inequities so new rules and institutions can be put in place" (150).
- "Controls must be placed on the institutions of overconsumption and wasteful consumption, including the automobile industry, the chemical industry, the construction industry, the fossil fuel industry, the mining industry, the fishing industry, the timber industry, the advertising industry, the fast food industry, the discount retail industry, and the agricultural industry" (151).
- "a politics of global sustainability must respect nature, demand intergenerational equity, advance environmental justice, and promote fair economics without irreparably harming present or future life. It must restrain corporations as well as unbalanced growth and consumption. And it must recognize that socioeconomic and ecological systems interlock, putting in place measures to balance systems that are interacting with increasing speed and volatility" (151).
