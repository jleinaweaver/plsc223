**Has anybody watched the Ken Burns documentary on the national parks?**

<br>

It's a 12 hour documentary split across six episodes

- Thoroughly enjoyable, and very gentle

- An excellent watch, especially if you're a little tired... :)

<br>

Today I want to show you clips from the first two episodes that cover the early years of our national parks development

- Let's add some historical color to our thinking about the battle between conservationists and preservationists

<br>

1. Yosemite

    - **Episode 1, 13:46 - 29:00 (15 mins)**
    
    - Yosemite found, presence of god, here comes the people, Lincoln preserves Yosemite to protect this Garden of Eden!

2. Yellowstone

    - **Episode 1, 1:08:28 - 1:30:39 (22 mins)**
    
    - "Discovery" and creation of Yellowstone (including expulsion of the natives) and the ensuing fight over who would manage/control the first national park in the world. These are the same debates we are having today.

3. Muir (preservation)

    - **Episode 2, 28:19 - 32:47 (5 mins)**
    
    - The wilds are being overrun, Muir forms Sierra Club, wilderness redeems man NOT vice versa, 

4. Pinchot (conservation)

    - **Episode 2, 46:35 - 52:58 (6 mins)**

    - Gifford Pinchot introduced and contrasted with Muir. Pinchot: The greatest good for the greatest number. Two sides of the same coin. Government sides with Pinchot.

5. Battle over the flooding the Hetch Hetchy Valley

    - **Episode 2, 1:49:49 - 2:07:15 (18 mins)**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Assignment for AFTER the field trip

**The Environmental Justice Problem: Nationally**
:::

- Read Bullard, Mohai, Saha and Wright (2007) on toxic waste exposure in the US

- Find us evidence to answer two questions:

    1. What are the primary environmental justice problems we currently face?
    
    2. How substantial are these problems?

::: notes

Important: Focus on evidence about the problem on the national level

- We'll focus on our backyard, SGF, the week after

- For THIS we want big picture evidence

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Canvas Assignment: The Environmental Justice Problem

Review Chapters 3 and 4 of the Bullard, Mohai, Saha and Wright (2007) report then go find us a news report or piece of published research on the scope of the environmental justice problem as it exists in America today. Specifically, I want your evidence to help us answer two broad questions: What are the primary environmental justice problems we currently face and how substantial are they?

Submit: 1) an APA citation to your evidence, 2) an explanation of how this helps us identify the current environmental justice problems, and 3) an explanation of how this helps us define the scope of the problems

Notes:

- Our interest is in examining the distribution of environmental harms, not just toxic waste, across the various groupings in our society (e.g. race, ethnicity, income, urban vs rural, education, etc)
- NO OVERLAPPING evidence. First-come, first-served.
