**Has anybody watched the Ken Burns documentary on the national parks?**

<br>

It's a 12 hour documentary split across six episodes

- Thoroughly enjoyable, and very gentle

- An excellent watch, especially if you're a little tired... :)

<br>

Today I want to show you clips from the first two episodes that cover the early years of our national parks development

- Let's add some historical color to our thinking about the battle between conservationists and preservationists

<br>

1. Yosemite

    - **Episode 1, 13:46 - 29:00 (15 mins)**
    
    - Yosemite found, presence of god, here comes the people, Lincoln preserves Yosemite to protect this Garden of Eden!

2. Yellowstone

    - **Episode 1, 1:08:28 - 1:30:39 (22 mins)**
    
    - "Discovery" and creation of Yellowstone (including expulsion of the natives) and the ensuing fight over who would manage/control the first national park in the world. These are the same debates we are having today.

3. Muir (preservation)

    - **Episode 2, 28:19 - 32:47 (5 mins)**
    
    - The wilds are being overrun, Muir forms Sierra Club, wilderness redeems man NOT vice versa, 

4. Pinchot (conservation)

    - **Episode 2, 46:35 - 52:58 (6 mins)**

    - Gifford Pinchot introduced and contrasted with Muir. Pinchot: The greatest good for the greatest number. Two sides of the same coin. Government sides with Pinchot.

5. Battle over the flooding the Hetch Hetchy Valley

    - **Episode 2, 1:49:49 - 2:07:15 (18 mins)**
