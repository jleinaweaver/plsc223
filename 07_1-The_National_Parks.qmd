## For Tuesday (Oct 7th) {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The Environmental Justice Problem**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Read Bullard, Mohai, Saha and Wright (2007) on toxic waste exposure in the US

- Find us evidence: What kinds of current national problems and how big are they?
:::

::: notes

Next week we begin the next section of the class focused on current problems in American environmentalism

- Specifically, we'll begin with issues related to environmental justice.

<br>

**REVEAL**: *Read assignment*

<br>

Important: Focus on evidence about the problem on the national level

- For THIS we want big picture evidence (e.g. national trends, scientific research, etc)

- We'll focus on our backyard, in SGF and SW MO, in week 9

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, today I want to add some material on the personalities underpinning the historical perspectives we've been exploring

<br>

Canvas Assignment: The Environmental Justice Problem

Review Chapters 3 and 4 of the Bullard, Mohai, Saha and Wright (2007) report then go find us a news report or piece of published research on the scope of the environmental justice problem as it exists in America today. Specifically, I want your evidence to help us answer two broad questions: What are the primary environmental justice problems we currently face and how substantial are they?

Submit: 1) an APA citation to your evidence, 2) an explanation of how this helps us identify the current environmental justice problems, and 3) an explanation of how this helps us define the scope of the problems

Notes:

- Our interest is in examining the distribution of environmental harms, not just toxic waste, across the various groupings in our society (e.g. race, ethnicity, income, urban vs rural, education, etc)
- NO OVERLAPPING evidence. First-come, first-served.

**Has anybody watched the Ken Burns documentary on the national parks?**

<br>

It's a 12 hour documentary split across six episodes

- Thoroughly enjoyable, and very gentle

- An excellent watch, especially if you're a little tired... :)

<br>

Today I want to show you clips from the first two episodes that cover the early years of our national parks development

- Let's add some historical color to our thinking about the battle between the historical perspectives on wilderness

- No screens, let's all watch this together and discuss!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start with the "discovery" of Yosemite

And by discovery I mean by white people

- **Clip 1: Episode 1, 13:46 - 29:00 (15 mins)**

<br>

**Ok, talk to me about the early years of Yosemite. What stood out to you in clip?**

- **Is Burns adopting one of the perspectives more than the others OR is he simply reflecting the history of the time as he has found it?**

<br>

- Soldier quote about the beauty of what they've found contrasted with the battalion burning indian villages

- The irony of the creation and naming of Yosemite which actually means "the people who should be feared" because they are killers

- Visitors must struggle to access it and what they see blows their minds

- Presence of / "relationship" with God. "God of the mountaintop"

- BUT, here come the people! Manifest Destiny, baby!

- We need a "nation's park" to preserve it. We've already ruined Niaga Falls.

- Lincoln preserves Yosemite to protect this Garden of Eden!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's jump to Yellowstone!

**Clip 2: Creation of Yellowstone (12 mins)**

- **Episode 1, 1:08:28 - 1:17:23 (9 mins on founding)**

- **Episode 1, 1:22:22 - 1:25:23 (3 mins on exploitation)**

<br>

**Ok, talk to me about the early years of Yellowstone What stood out to you in clip?**

- **Is Burns adopting one of the perspectives more than the others OR is he simply reflecting the history of the time as he has found it?**

<br>

- Opens with native park ranger describing the insanity of discovering what had never been lost to his people

-  New expedition aims to find anything of value!

- "Discovery" and creation of Yellowstone (including expulsion of the natives) and the ensuing fight over who would manage/control the first national park in the world. These are the same debates we are having today.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's meet John Muir and Gifford Pinchot

**Clip 3: Muir vs Pinchot (12 mins)**

- **Episode 2, 27:48 - 32:47 (5 mins)**

- **Clip 4: Episode 2, 46:35 - 52:58 (6 mins)**

<br>

**Ok, talk to me about this introduction to Muir and Pinchot. What stood out to you in these clips?**

- **Is Burns giving both of these actors the same platform? The same level of admiration? Why or why not?**

<br>

Muir
    
- The wilds are being overrun

- God has "protected" these trees from all natural threats but "he cannot save them from fools, only Uncle Sam can do that" 

- Muir forms Sierra Club to "make the mountains glad"

- The "frontier line" redeeming wilderness for man vs wilderness redeems man

<br>

Pinchot

- Pinchot: The greatest good for the greatest number. Two sides of the same coin.

- Government sides with Pinchot.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last clip focuses on the battle over the flooding the Hetch Hetchy Valley

- The need for water in San Francisco vs a national park
