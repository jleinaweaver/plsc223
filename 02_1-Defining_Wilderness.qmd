Thursday our first field trip of the semester

- We're meeting at the Springfield Conservation Nature Center

- We'll gather there at 9:35a and spend an hour (time to travel back to campus)

<br>

**Does everybody have a plan for how to get there?**

- **Any questions on the trip?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Refresh our work from last week

**What is "the environment"?**

- e.g. "nature" or "wilderness"
:::

::: notes

Let's kick off our work today with a refresher from last week

- Everybody open up our "pure nature" document on Canvas

<br>

**What are the "best" examples of pure wilderness on Drury's campus on this document? Why?**

<br>

Open up the "not" nature document

- **What are the "most" not nature of the photos that were submitted? why?**

<br>

**On balance, where would you classify Drury's campus in terms of "pure nature," "managed nature" and "not nature"? Make your case!**

<br>

**Would it be "better" if Drury were closer to "pure nature"? Why or why not?**

- **Better for who?**

- **Better for what?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: For today I gave you the prologoue from Roderick Frazier Nash's book

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02_1-Nash_Book_Cover.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Nash's book is a phenomenal exploration of the American relationship with wilderness across time

- I was super tempted to assign this book as a throughline for our class, but it gets pretty wonky pretty darn fast

- I also wanted to keep us rooted in primary source material whenever possible

<br>

So, we stick with the prologue!

- I really appreciate the clarity, depth and conciseness of the prologue as a deep dive into our key concept, wilderness

- **SLIDE**: Let's dig into the reading as an academic argument.

![](Images/02_1-Nash_Book_Cover.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

*Split class into small groups (3 per)*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

The Nash book is definitely an academic argument and that means it should have a clear thesis.

- Groups, reflect on the prologue and get ready to tell me what the central argument of this chapter is.

<br>

**So, what is Nash's thesis in this prologue?**

- **What central argument is Nash trying to convince you of?**

- *Give them a chance to throw out some ideas*

- *Note for you: The wilderness as spectrum is an extension of the argument you want to start with, e.g. if you accept wilderness is a quality then our best approach is the spectrum*

<br>

There are a lot of big important ideas in this seven pages (so concise!), but I think the argument comes early in the reading

- **SLIDE**: on next slide is your version, e.g. "Wilderness is an evolving, subjective 'quality' NOT an object we can simply identify"

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### Wilderness is an evolving, subjective "quality" NOT an object we can simply identify

::: notes

**What does this mean?**

- **Can somebody explain this in clearer terms?**

<br>

Wilderness describes the "quality" of a thing, not a fixed object in and of itself

- e.g. something can have the characteristics of wilderness, but is not necessarily wilderness by definitions

- **Does that distinction make sense?**

<br>

Take a minute to reflect on the chapter with the people around you.

- What I want you to do is to identify the key premises that support this conclusion

- What are the reasons Nash gives to convince us that wilderness is an evolving quality and not a thing?

<br>

Groups, report back!

- *Collect proposed premises ON BOARD*

- *Present and Discuss each*

- *AGAIN, Note for you: Save the "wilderness as a spectrum" for next slide discussion. e.g. If this argument is convincing, then this is our path forward*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Your version (3 premises)

<br>

*Chapter notes: Prologue*

**NOTES**

Wilderness is a subjective quality, not an object that can be identified  

- Everyone defines it differently and prioritizes different qualities when doing so PLUS the cultural definitions have also changed dramatically across time

Etymology of Wilderness  

- Early Teutonic and Norse languages the root is “will” meaning willful or uncontrollable
- “Willed” becomes “wild” meaning lost, unruly, disordered or confused (in Old Swedish wild came from describing boiling water)  
- Old English adds animal (deor) and we get creatures not under the control of man (see the wildeor in Beowulf)  
- “wild-deor-ness” the place of wild beasts

Wilderness in Human Terms  

- Wilderness as a region where people get into “a disordered, confused or ‘wild’ condition (p2).  
- “bewilder” adds “be” and refers to a man in an alien environment where the civilization that normally structures our lives is absent

First uses of wilderness  

- Early 13th century, but more common in 14th when used in translations of the Bible, wilderness as treeless wasteland, “a desert; a tract of solitude and savageness” (Samuel Johnson 1755 Dictionary of the English Language)

Today  

- Dictionaries define wilderness as uncultivated or otherwise undeveloped land  
- Also include “any place in which a person feels stripped of guidance, lost, and perplexed

Interestingly, some German sources have paired this negative conception (wilderness as inhospitable, alien, mysterious) with one more positive (wilderness as beautiful, friendly, capable of elevating and delighting the beholder)

Wilderness as Classification 

- This becomes all the more challenging  
- How much human interference is allowable while still calling a place wild? How big does it have to be?  
- Various ballpark definitions across time: an area so large you cannot traverse it in one day (without mechanical means), or only if it can “absorb a two weeks’ pack trip” (p4-5)  
- US Forest Service experimented with terms like primitive, roadless and natural but they didn’t really solve the problem  
- The Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission (1962): Areas over 100,000 acres containing no roads usable by the public with “no significant ecological disturbance from on-site human activity”  
- A National Wilderness Preservation System (US Statutes at Large, 78 1964): an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man; must retain its primeval character and influence.

A Spectrum of Environments (p6-7)  

- Ranging from the “purely wild” to the “purely civilized”  
- The middle are the rural or pastoral environment (the ploughed) that represents a balance of the forces of nature and man  
- Moving from the middle to the wilderness pole means human influence appears less frequently; think man as an outpost in the wilderness  
- The opposite direction for increasing levels of human interference; think man shaping nature  
- Implies a shading or blending between two poles; Puts a premium on “variations of intensity rather than on absolutes”

## Nash's (2014) Argument {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

1. The origination and use of "wilderness" as a label differed across cultures

2. The meaning of wilderness has evolved over time 

3. No single classification of wilderness accepted broadly

Therefore, wilderness is an evolving, subjective "quality" NOT an object we can simply identify

::: notes

I want to highlight these three premises (big ideas)

<br>

If the intuition held by so many is wilderness is a concrete thing we can identify and agree on, then these are serious problems!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Expand on P1

:::



## Nash's (2014) Argument {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

1. The origination and use of "wilderness" as a label differed across cultures

    - Lost, unruly, disordered (Old Swedish describe boiling water)
    
    - Creatures not controlled by man ("wild-deor-ness")
    
    - Places that make us wild ("bewilder")

2. The meaning of wilderness has evolved over time 

3. No single classification of wilderness accepted broadly

Therefore, wilderness is an evolving, subjective "quality" NOT an object we can simply identify

::: notes

Different cultures and places came to the concept in different ways

- For some wilderness is a state of disorder

- Others focused on the places dominated by the beasts of the wild and their dangers

- Still others proposed wilderness as a place where the constraint of society are removed and man becomes like a wild animal

<br>

These are all discrete and SEPARATE definitions of wilderness.

- If you want to argue wilderness is a thing you have to grapple with the fact that different cultures looked at "it" and focused on very different elements of it

3. No single classification of wilderness accepted broadly

::: notes

Expanding on P2

- Through use words evolve and that has been true of wilderness

- If the wilderness is a fixed thing, then we need a word for it that points to the essential and unchanging quality of it

- Wilderness ain't it

<br>

Expanding on P3

- Again, we are confronted by the fact that even today, and despite many attempts, we do not have a single, widely adopted consensus definition for wilderness as a "thing"

<br>

**Ok, bottom line, are you convinced by Nash's argument? Why or why not?**

- **Is wilderness a quality rather than a thing?**

<br>

All of this leads to Nash's proposal for moving forward with this concept

- **SLIDE**: If wilderness or nature is a quality, then our best bet is to evaluate it on a spectrum

:::


## A Spectrum of Environments {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 6, fig.height=1.25}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Purely\nCivilized", "Purely\nWild")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +

  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.9, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow(ends = "both"))
```

::: notes

Talk me through this a bit:

- **How does Nash define the quality of something that is purely wild?**

    - (Seems to be: The absence of human influence on the environment)

- **What about purely civilized?**

    - (The highest levels of human intereference or shaping of the environment)

- **And what are the qualities of something precisely in the middle?**

    - (The middle are the rural or pastoral environment (the ploughed) that represents a balance of the forces of nature and man)

<br>

**How does this approach compare to our work last class evaluating our examples from the Drury campus**

- (Similar in approach, possibly different in precise terms)

<br>

I want to make sure that this conceptual step Nash is making is clear to you

- At this moment in the chapter he is no longer tracking wilderness, he is now defining "the environment"

- **If we adopt Nash's perspective, then what is our definition of the environment?**

- (**SLIDE**)

From this perspective the environment is everything around us.

- There are no distinctions to be raised about how far "environmental" concerns can reach

- The question becomes what is the quality of the environments we live in and how should we balance the wild with the civilized in all of them

- **Does that make sense?**

<br>

**What are the implications for our society if we agree to stop thinking of wilderness as a "thing" and instead think of the environment as a spectrum?**

1. (Environmental defenses may be challenged)

    - (Might be harder to preserve wild lands in the form we want if we open this can of worms!)
    
    - (Since there is no wilderness developers may argue they are just moving an area a small way along the spectrum, not destroying perfection)
    
2. (Contra that, might open up MORE places to environmental protection!)

    - (If wildness is a quality then it can exist EVERYWHERE!)
    
    - And it it exists everywhere then we can seek to protect it everywhere
    
<br>

Everybody open the "not nature" examples we shared on Drury's campus

- All of these are opportunities to reintroduce some wildness into our environment

- **Give me some ideas using the spectrum! What could we do with all of these to push back on the "not nature" around us?**

<br>

**How are we doing? Everybody with me so far?**

<br>

Ok, this wider exploration of the environment leads us straight into our first paper assignment

::: notes

Your thesis is the conclusion of the paper

- e.g. what you want the reader to accept

Your thesis must be supported by multiple premises

- e.g. a premise is a reason for your conclusion

3. Body Paragraph: Reason 2 (premise)

4. Body Paragraph: Reason 3 (premise)

5. Conclusion Paragraph
:::

::: notes

This is the structure for a simple five paragraph essay.

- This the old "tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them" thing you've been doing since grade school

<br>

Your intro:

- grabs the reader's attention,

- Convinces the audience they want to read your paper, and 

- Makes clear exactly what you want them to take away from reading it

<br>

Each body paragraph gives:

- A reason supporting your conclusion, 

- Explains the reason in detail, and 

- Provides evidence to show this reason is consistent with reality!

<br>

Then the conclusion wraps it all up

<br>

More advanced papers simply innovate on this structure

- Add more paragraphs to support and defend each premise

- Add counter-argument paragraphs to raise and address the possibility that you could be wrong

- etc

<br>

**Has everybody written something like this before?**

<br>

My background is in the policy world which means a big part of my job is often trying to convince other people to change their behavior

- AND people aren't going to change their behavior if I haven't convinced them what I want to talk to them about is important

- **SLIDE**: That means I think introductions are incredibly important

::: notes

**Any questions on the prompt or the structure I am asking you to use?**

<br>

We're going to keep moving in this class so you'll be expected to take care of this ahead of the deadline next week on your own.

- Giving you the time to do that is partially why we are going on a field trip Thursday!

- My advice, figure out your thesis and premises, make an outline, add evidence then write it!

<br>

**ALL OF THIS** means we need ideas for why the wilderness is important!

- **SLIDE**: And that brings us to what you submitted to Canvas today!

<br>

**Paper 1: The Importance of Wilderness**

Make an argument that the wilderness is important to our community. 

- Please note that this is an argument paper, not an opinion piece. That means the paper must advance a single thesis (e.g. a central argument) built upon at least three premises (e.g. key reasons) and each premise must be explained and supported by high quality evidence. 

- In short, I am looking for an argument paper that provides the reader with specific, real-world examples that demonstrate the importance of the natural world to our lives.

- This assignment ties directly to Learning Outcome 1 (Content Knowledge: Students should learn to recognize how human behavior is shaped by the environment and how the environment is shaped by human behavior).

Everybody open up the discussion board of wilderness experiences

- This is a kind of group brainstorming for the first paper AND a chance to get to know your classmates better

<br>

*ON BOARD: Three headers (purely wild, perfectly balanced, purely civilized)*

<br>

As we hear each of these I want us to do two things:

1. Place this experience on the spectrum of environments

2. List the broader reasons revealed by this experience for why wilderness is important to society

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*
