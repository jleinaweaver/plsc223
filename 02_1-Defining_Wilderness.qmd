Thursday our first field trip of the semester

- We're meeting at the Springfield Conservation Nature Center

- We'll gather there at 9:35a and spend an hour (time to travel back to campus)

<br>

**Does everybody have a car?**

- **Anybody willing to car pool?**

**Where did we end up with our work defining the key concepts last week?**

<br>

**What were the "best" examples of pure wilderness on Drury's campus?**

<br>

**And what were our most amusing examples of NOT nature from our campus?**

![](Images/02_1-Nash_Book_Cover.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

As I told you last class, the Nash book is a phenomenal exploration of the American relationship with wilderness across time

- And I really appreciate the clarity, depth and conciseness of the prologue you read for class today

- I was super tempted to assign this book as a throughline for our class, but it gets pretty wonky pretty darn fast

- I also wanted to keep us rooted in primary source material whenever possible

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's dig into the reading as an academic argument.

**What is central argument in this prologue?**
:::

![](Images/02_1-Nash_Book_Cover.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

If this is an academic argument then it must have a thesis!

<br>

**So, what is Nash's thesis in this prologue?**

- **What central argument is Nash trying to convince you of?**

- *Give them a chance to throw out some ideas*

- *Note for you: The wilderness as spectrum is an extension of the argument you want to start with, e.g. if you accept wilderness is a quality then our best approach is the spectrum*

<br>

There are a lot of big important ideas in this seven pages (so concise!), but I think the argument comes early in the reading

- **SLIDE**: on next slide - Wilderness is an evolving, subjective "quality" NOT an object we can simply identify

### Wilderness is an evolving, subjective "quality" NOT an object we can simply identify

::: notes

**What does this mean?**

- **Can somebody explain this in clearer terms?**

<br>

Wilderness describes the "quality" of a thing, not a fixed object in and of itself

- e.g. something can have the characteristics of wilderness, but is not necessarily wilderness by definitions

- **Does that distinction make sense?**

<br>

Take a minute to reflect on the chapter with the people around you.

- What I want you to do is to identify the key premises that support this conclusion

- What are the reasons Nash gives to convince us that wilderness is an evolving quality and not a thing?

<br>

Groups, report back!

- *Collect proposed premises ON BOARD*

- *Present and Discuss each*

- *AGAIN, Note for you: Save the "wilderness as a spectrum" for next slide discussion. e.g. If this argument is convincing, then this is our path forward*

<br>

All of this leads to Nash's proposal for moving forward with this concept

- **SLIDE**: If wilderness or nature is a quality, then our best bet is to evaluate it on a spectrum

<br>

**NOTES**

Wilderness is a subjective quality, not an object that can be identified  

- Everyone defines it differently and prioritizes different qualities when doing so PLUS the cultural definitions have also changed dramatically across time

Etymology of Wilderness  

- Early Teutonic and Norse languages the root is “will” meaning willful or uncontrollable
- “Willed” becomes “wild” meaning lost, unruly, disordered or confused (in Old Swedish wild came from describing boiling water)  
- Old English adds animal (deor) and we get creatures not under the control of man (see the wildeor in Beowulf)  
- “wild-deor-ness” the place of wild beasts

Wilderness in Human Terms  

- Wilderness as a region where people get into “a disordered, confused or ‘wild’ condition (p2).  
- “bewilder” adds “be” and refers to a man in an alien environment where the civilization that normally structures our lives is absent

First uses of wilderness  

- Early 13th century, but more common in 14th when used in translations of the Bible, wilderness as treeless wasteland, “a desert; a tract of solitude and savageness” (Samuel Johnson 1755 Dictionary of the English Language)

Today  

- Dictionaries define wilderness as uncultivated or otherwise undeveloped land  
- Also include “any place in which a person feels stripped of guidance, lost, and perplexed

Interestingly, some German sources have paired this negative conception (wilderness as inhospitable, alien, mysterious) with one more positive (wilderness as beautiful, friendly, capable of elevating and delighting the beholder)

Wilderness as Classification 

- This becomes all the more challenging  
- How much human interference is allowable while still calling a place wild? How big does it have to be?  
- Various ballpark definitions across time: an area so large you cannot traverse it in one day (without mechanical means), or only if it can “absorb a two weeks’ pack trip” (p4-5)  
- US Forest Service experimented with terms like primitive, roadless and natural but they didn’t really solve the problem  
- The Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission (1962): Areas over 100,000 acres containing no roads usable by the public with “no significant ecological disturbance from on-site human activity”  
- A National Wilderness Preservation System (US Statutes at Large, 78 1964): an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man; must retain its primeval character and influence.

A Spectrum of Environments (p6-7)  

- Ranging from the “purely wild” to the “purely civilized”  
- The middle are the rural or pastoral environment (the ploughed) that represents a balance of the forces of nature and man  
- Moving from the middle to the wilderness pole means human influence appears less frequently; think man as an outpost in the wilderness  
- The opposite direction for increasing levels of human interference; think man shaping nature  
- Implies a shading or blending between two poles; Puts a premium on “variations of intensity rather than on absolutes”

```

::: notes

Talk me through this a bit:

- **How does Nash define the quality of something that is purely wild?**

    - (Seems to be: The absence of human influence on the environment)

- **What about purely civilized?**

    - (The highest levels of human intereference or shaping of the environment)

- **And what are the qualities of something precisely in the middle?**

    - (The middle are the rural or pastoral environment (the ploughed) that represents a balance of the forces of nature and man)

<br>

**How does this approach compare to our work last class evaluating our examples from the Drury campus**

<br>

**Does this work as an answer to the question, what is the environment? Why or why not?**

- *Force this discussion: BOTH pro and con*

<br>

Ok, this wider exploration of the environment leads us straight into our first paper assignment

- **SLIDE**

**Paper 1: The Importance of Wilderness**
:::

<br>

Make an argument that the wilderness is important to our community

- Due next Friday (Sep 5th)

::: notes

This prompt, with a few more details, is on Canvas in the Assignments section

<br>

Paper has a quick deadline

- Gives me a baseline for your writing, and 

- Allows us to work directly on LO1 which sets us up for harder material to come

    - Content Knowledge: Students should learn to recognize how human behavior is shaped by the environment and how the environment is shaped by human behavior

<br>

**Has everybody here written a short argument paper before?**

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Paper 1: The Importance of Wilderness**

<br>

An argument paper **MUST**: 

1. Be organized around a single, clear **thesis**

2. Include **multiple premises**

3. Provide **high quality evidence** for all claims of fact

:::

::: notes

Your thesis is the conclusion of the paper

- e.g. what you want the reader to accept

<br>

Your thesis must be supported by multiple premises

- e.g. a premise is a reason for your conclusion

<br>

EACH premise must be supported by multiple examples of high quality evidence

<br>

**Five Paragraph Argument Paper**

1. Introduction Paragraph

2. Body Paragraph: Reason 1 (premise)

3. Body Paragraph: Reason 2 (premise)

4. Body Paragraph: Reason 3 (premise)

5. Conclusion Paragraph
:::

::: notes

This is the structure for a simple five paragraph essay.

- This the old "tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them" thing you've been doing since grade school

- Your intro grabs the reader's attention and should establish that they want to read your paper AND that they know what you want them to take away from it

- Each body paragraph gives a reason supporting your conclusion, explains the reason and provides evidence for it

- Then the conclusion wraps it up

<br>

More advanced papers simply innovate on this structure

- Add more paragraphs to support and defend each premise

- Add counter-argument paragraphs to raise and address the possibility that you could be wrong

- etc

<br>

**Has everybody written something like this before?**

<br>

My background is in the policy world which means a big part of my job is often trying to convince other people to change their behavior

- AND people aren't going to change their behavior if I haven't convinced them what I want to talk to them about is important

- **SLIDE**: That means I think introductions are incredibly important

**Paper 1: The Importance of Wilderness**
:::

<br>

Make an argument that the wilderness is important to our community

- Due next Friday (Sep 5th)

::: notes

**Any questions on the prompt or the structure I am asking you to use?**

<br>

We're going to keep moving in this class so you'll be expected to take care of this ahead of the deadline next week on your own.

- Giving you the time to do that is partially why we are going on a field trip Thursday!

- My advice, figure out your thesis and premises, make an outline, add evidence then write it!

<br>

That means we need ideas for why the wilderness is important...

- **SLIDE**: And that brings us to what you submitted to Canvas today!

<br>

**Paper 1: The Importance of Wilderness**

Make an argument that the wilderness is important to our community. 

- Please note that this is an argument paper, not an opinion piece. That means the paper must advance a single thesis (e.g. a central argument) built upon at least three premises (e.g. key reasons) and each premise must be explained and supported by high quality evidence. 

- In short, I am looking for an argument paper that provides the reader with specific, real-world examples that demonstrate the importance of the natural world to our lives.

- This assignment ties directly to Learning Outcome 1 (Content Knowledge: Students should learn to recognize how human behavior is shaped by the environment and how the environment is shaped by human behavior).

## Share a Wilderness Experience {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/02_1-hiking.webp)

::: notes

Everybody open up the discussion board of wilderness experiences

- This is a kind of group brainstorming for the first paper AND a chance to get to know your classmates better

<br>

For each:

1. How close to "pure wilderness" is this?

2. What possible reasons does this give us that the wilderness is important to society?

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

:::





## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Get those papers done (for next week), and

2. Meet at the Nature Center on Thursday
