Today we kick off Section 3 of the class

- Section 3: Current Challenges in American Environmentalism

<br>

Specifically, we'll be focusing on environmental justice over the next three weeks

- This week we define the problem and the scope

- Next week we look into our Springfield backyard to measure the problem

- Then we'll engage with some of the activism being done in our community to address these problems

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today we begin exploring the material on environmental justice beginning the the Bullard, Mohai, Saha & Wright report from 2007

::: notes

In 1982, North Carolina "chose a poor predominantly African American community for the placement of a toxic waste landfill to dispose of PCBs illegally dumped along the roadway of fourteen counties" (viii).

- Members of that community reached out to the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice (CRJ) for help

<br>

The United Church of Christ (UCC) is a church that has long taken its role in the community very seriously

- This report coming out of North Carolina was not the first they had received and they were growing concerned

<br>

In response, the UCC commissioned a "study to examine what was perceived at the time to be the intentional placement of hazardous waste sites, landfills, incinerators, and polluting industries in communities inhabited mainly by African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians and Pacific Islanders, farm workers and the working poor" (viii).

- This report helped launch a movement across the country meant to help us document these damages and then to serve as a demand for protection of these communities

<br>

**SLIDE**: 20 years later

::: notes

Twenty years later the UCC once again commissioned a group of experts to analyze the problem and see what progress had been made.

- For today I asked each of you to read chapters 3 and 4 from that updated report.

<br>

**What is the key takeaway of reading these chapters?**

- **Are hazardous waste facilities in the US more likely to be near people of color and the poor?**

<br>

Main Conclusion: Preponderance of the research since 1987 shows "environmental hazards of a wide variety are distributed inequitably by race and socioeconomic status" (38).

- **SLIDE**: Let's look at some of the data

![](Images/08_1-Bullard_Table_3_1.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Here we see a tabular summary of the average data in 1990.

- Each column represents the average value for people living within set distances from a hazardous waste facility.

![](Images/08_1-Bullard_Table_3_1_2.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Focus first on just the difference between those super close and those far away.

- **What do we see in the data?**

<br>

These results are consistent even when including up to 3km away as "close".

<br>

**Why do the authors adopt 3km as their definition of closeness?**

- Focusing on 3km (1.8mi) radius which "corresponds to the distance within which empirical studies have noted adverse health, property value and quality of life impacts associated with hazardous waste sites, including hazardous waste facilities (see Methods Appendix)."

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's jump forward in time

::: notes

**What do we learn from their updated data in 2000? Are things getting better?**

- "Overall, Table 4.1 shows that the magnitude of racial and socioeconomic disparities did not change appreciably between 1990 and 2000. It is notable, however, that during the 1990s the percentages of people of color increased in the United States such that people of color now comprise a majority of the population living near the nation’s commercial hazardous waste facilities" (54).

<br>

**What else stood out for you in reading these two chapters of the report?**

- **Per this evidence, do we have a problem and how serious is it?**

<br>

I like to kick off our work today with this report as our touchstone

- It is a powerful call for political change,

- It was generated through a partnership of religious and academic institutions working together for common cause, and

- It is a high quality piece of scientific evidence 

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, let's use your submissions to bring us forward in time on this

<br>

**Notes**

Bullard et al 2007 ch 4

- Updates analysis in chapter 3 using more up-to-date data (2007 EPA and 2000 census)
- Five questions on p49
1. What is the current extent of racial and socioeconomic disparities in the location of the nation’s commercial hazardous waste facilities?
2. Did disparities increase during the 1990s?
3. Are disparities greater for host neighborhoods with clustered facilities?
4. How are racial and socioeconomic disparities distributed in different regions of the country?
5. How important is race in predicting facility location in comparison to socioeconomic status and other non­racial factors?
- Focusing on 3km (1.8mi) radius which "corresponds to the distance within which empirical studies have noted adverse health, property value and quality of life impacts associated with hazardous waste sites, including hazardous waste facilities (see Methods Appendix)."
- More than nine million people (9,222,000) are estimated to live within 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) of the nation’s 413 commercial hazardous waste facilities (52).
- Table 4.1 is the updated Table 3.1
- "Overall, Table 4.1 shows that the magnitude of racial and socioeconomic disparities did not change appreciably between 1990 and 2000. It is notable, however, that during the 1990s the percentages of people of color increased in the United States such that people of color now comprise a majority of the population living near the nation’s commercial hazardous waste facilities" (54).
- 2000: Host neighborhood 55.9% people of color vs non-host 30% (26% difference or saying people of color are 1.86x more likely to live within 3km of TSDF)
- 2000: Host neighborhood 18% poverty rate vs non-host 12% (6.1% difference or saying people in poverty 1.5x more likely to live within 3km of TSDF)
- Some evidence that this is worse in certain EPA regions than others. 
- Region 5 (Great Lake states) is real bad! 52.6% PoC vs 18.8% PoC in non-host areas. 33.8% higher!
- Region 9 real bad too (CA, AZ, NV). 80.5% PoC vs 49.4% PoC in non-host areas. 31.1% higher!
- Figure 4.3 shows states with biggest discrepancies by race
- "This analysis shows that statistically significant racial and socioeconomic disparities in the location of commercial hazardous waste facilities are very prevalent among the states and thus throughout the country" (60).
- "This analysis of the states also shows that racial disparities are more prevalent and extensive than socioeconomic disparities, suggesting that race has more to do with the current distribution of the nation’s hazardous waste facilities than poverty" (60).

**The Environmental Justice Problem: Cases**

1. What is the specific problem?

2. What groups are suffering disproportionate harm?

3. How serious or substantial is the problem?

:::
    
::: notes

*ON BOARD: Three Columns*

- Environmental Justice Problem
- Groups Impacted
- Size of the Problem

<br>

Let's go around the room to hear each of your pieces of evidence

- We'll track it all on the board using these three categories (or more if we need)

<br>

**Questions?**

- Let's go!

<br>

**Ok, takeaways from all our cases?**

<br>

- **Do we currently have an environmental justice problem?**

- **What groups are being targeted most frequently?**

- **How substantial or sizable are these problems?**

- **At this point would you argue that environmentalism needs to take the justice problem as seriously as it does the desire to protect "nature"? Why or why not?**

<br>

We next have to take this conversation into some SUPER uncomfortable places for me

- **SLIDE**: Does our country have an environmental justice problem or an environmental racism problem?

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Environmental Justice Issues: How did we get here?**
:::

- Kashwan (2020) on Muir and Audubon

- Mildenberger (2019) on Hardin

- Diem (2024) on NIMBY

- Pittman (2024) on redlining

::: notes

For next class I've given you a series of short readings that will set us up to discuss the WHY behind some of the environmental justice problems we currently face

- Read these and then submit a reflection on Canvas

- Prompt details are on the assignment for Thursday

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Canvas Assignment: What do we do with the flawed actors or our past?

The readings for today make compelling arguments that key figures in American environmentalism like John Muir, John James Audubon and Garrett Hardin were motivated, at least in part, by discriminatory worldviews. 

Are you persuaded that American environmentalism must stop honoring these figures if we hope to build an inclusive movement going forward? In other words, is it time to stop reading and debating the arguments of these authors? Why or why not?
