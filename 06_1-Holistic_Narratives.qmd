Last class we turned our analytical focus on the Bass Pro Shops

- Let's review your submissions as a way to refresh our memories on the competing perspectives of wilderness

<br>

*Highlight class picks from Canvas for the following prompts:*

- **What stood out as your favorite pieces of evidence for the Edenic narrative at Bass Pro?**

- **What stood out as your favorite pieces of evidence for the sublime narrative at Bass Pro?**

- **What stood out as your favorite pieces of evidence for the utility narrative at Bass Pro?**

<br>

**Bottom line: Is Bass Pro "walking the walk" or only "talking the talk" on being good stewards of the environment?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today we turn to our final historical perspective on wilderness, what I am labeling holisitic narratives

:::
::::

::: notes

For our purposes I am treating deep ecology and ecocentrism as both advancing "holistic" narratives of wilderness

- In short, these "holistic narratives" encourage us to stop filtering environmentalism through an anthropocentric lens

- Anthropocentrism: "regarding humankind as the central or most important element of existence" (Oxford Languages)

<br>

Advocates of these narratives argue that centering the experience of wilderness and the biosphere in our decision-making is the only sustainable path forward for our society

- **Has anybody encountered deep ecology or ecocentrism concepts before now? Where and in what ways?**

<br>

I have always found these ideas incredibly compelling

- It makes perfect sense to me that centering the biosphere in our policy-making would lead to a healthier environment

- **REVEAL**

- The problem is, at what cost?

- Today's big picture aim is to ask: Is ecocentrism the next step towards a more productive environmentalism or a step on the road to eco-fascism?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start with one of my favorite writers, Aldo Leopold

Aldo Leopold was a writer, philosopher and naturalist working at the start of the 20th century

- His Sand County Almanac is a brilliant book that I highly recommend you all read.

- Think of it as Muir but without the 19th century racism!

- Plus you can pick it up for only like $8 and it is well worth it.

<br>

*Split class into small groups*

- GROUPS, take a few minutes to discuss the chapter on your own

- What stood out to you as important? What resonated with you?

- Was there anything you found problematic?

- Go!

<br>

Ok, I want to hear all this good stuff, but I also want to direct our conversation to the key arguments as best I can.

- **SLIDE**: Let's begin by contrasting Leopold's views to the other perspectives on wilderness

**Ok, easy case first, what does Leopold think of the Edenic perspective on wilderness?**

- **Groups, dig into the reading find us quotes that most directly address this question!**

<br>

Imagining we exist separate from our "resources" is insane, and inconsistent with basic evolutionary science

- “Land, then, is not merely soil; it is a fountain of energy flowing through a circuit of soils, plants, and animals. Food chains are the living channels which conduct energy upward; death and decay return it to the soil. The circuit is not closed; some energy is dissipated in decay, some is added by absorption from the air, some is stored in soils, peats, and long-lived forests; but it is a sustained circuit, like a slowly augmented revolving fund of life” (216).

- 205-207: Argues human history is shaped entirely by how the land reacted to our presence and use. Kentucky bluegrass allowed human development and expansion in ways that southern states couldn’t replicate with their shruberry and erosion problems.

<br>

**Ok, shift to the next easiest case, what does Leopold think of the utility perspective on wilderness?**

- **Groups, dig into the reading find us quotes that most directly address this question!**

<br>

He's HIGHLY critical of it!

- “One basic weakness in a conservation system based wholly on economic motives is that most members of the land community have no economic value” (210).

- "It tends to relegate to government many functions eventually too large, too complex, or too widely dispersed to be performed by government” (214).

- “Conservation is paved with good intentions which prove to be futile, or even dangerous, because they are devoid of critical understanding either of the land, or of economic land-use” (225).

- Why is conservation such an uphill battle? The absence of an ecological conscience: “The District is a beautiful piece of social machinery, but it is coughing along on two cylinders because we have been too timid, and too anxious for quick success, to tell the farmer the true magnitude of his obligations. Obligations have no meaning without conscience, and the problem we face is the extension of the social conscience from people to land” (209).

<br>

**Ok, toughest case time, how would Leopold evaluate the sublime perspective on wilderness?**

- **Groups, dig into the reading find us quotes that most directly address this question!**

<br>

My guess is that he would be sympathetic to it, BUT he doesn't see us as fundamentally separate from nature

- “In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it” (204).

Plus, figuring out what is "pristine" is probably beyond our science

- “The ordinary citizen today assumes that science knows what makes the community clock tick; the scientist is equally sure that he does not. He knows that the biotic mechanism is so complex that its workings may never be fully understood” (205).

The Land Ethic as a proposed solution

- “A land ethic, then, reflects the existence of an ecological conscience, and this in turn reflects a conviction of individual responsibility for the health of the land. Health is the capacity of the land for self-renewal. Conservation is our effort to understand and preserve this capacity” (221).

- “The ‘key-log’ which must be moved to release the evolutionary process for an ethic is simply this: quit thinking about decent land-use as solely an economic problem. Examine each question in terms of what is ethically and esthetically right, as well as what is economically expedient. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integdty, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise” (224-225).

<br>

Big picture for me:

- I have always appreciated how good Leopold is at explaining a complex set of ideas in simple and engaging ways

- And his critiques of modern conservation policy have always hit me very hard

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's now take this even deeper into the ecocentric philosophy

<br>

*Leopold Notes from Zotero*

Leopold, A. (1987). A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There. Oxford University Press. (Read "The Land Ethic" p201-226)

Section: The Ethical Sequence (202-207)

- "An ethic, philosophically, is a differentiation of social from anti-social conduct" (202).
- "An ethic, ecologically, is a limitation on freedom of action in the struggle for existence" (202).
- "The first ethics dealt with the relation between individuals" (see the Mosaic Decalogue aka the Ten Commandments)
- Ethics were then extended to deal with the relation between the individual and society (see the Golden Rule)
- The current problem: "There is as yet no ethic dealing with man's relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it" (203).
- Leopold argues this is an "ecological necessity"
- The power of making this an ethic: "An ethic may be regarded as a mode of guidance for meeting ecological situations so new or intricate, or involving such defened reactions, that the path of social expediency is not discernible to the average individual. Animal instincts are modes of guidance for the individual in meeting such situations. Ethics are possibly a kind of community instinct in-the-making" (203).
- "All ethics so far evolved rest upon a single premise: that the individual is a member of a community of interdependent parts. ... The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals; or collectively: the land." (203-204).
- "In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it" (204).
- "The ordinary citizen today assumes that science knows what makes the community clock tick; the scientist is equally sure that he does not. He knows that the biotic mechanism is so complex that its workings may never be fully understood" (205).
- 205-207: Argues human history is shaped entirely by how the land reacted to our presence and use. Kentucky bluegrass allowed human development and expansion in ways that southern states couldn't replicate with their shruberry and erosion problems.

Section: The Ecological Conscience (207-210)

- Why is conservation such an uphill battle? The absence of an ecological conscience
- Interesting example of failures in Wisconsin to leave rule-making to the farmers themselves (no rules created). *Push-back on Ostrom's principles or just extra context needed to make them work?*
- "The District is a beautiful piece of social machinery, but it is coughing along on two cylinders because we have been too timid, and too anxious for quick success, to tell the farmer the true magnitude of his obligations. Obligations have no meaning without conscience, and the problem we face is the extension of the social conscience from people to land" (209).

Section: Substitutes for a Land Ethic (210-214)

- "One basic weakness in a conservation system based wholly on economic motives is that most members of the land community have no economic value" (210).
- "When one of these non-economic categories is threatened, and if we happen to love it, we invent subteifuges to give it economic importance. At the beginning of the century song-birds were supposed to be disappearing. Ornithologists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them. The evidence had to be economic in order to be valid" (210).
- "To sum up: a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly lopsided. It tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are (as far as we know) essential to its healthy functioning. It assumes, falsely, I think, that the economic parts of the biotic clock will function without the uneconomic parts. It tends to relegate to government many functions eventually too
large, too complex, or too widely dispersed to be performed by government" (214).
- "An ethical obligation on the part of the private owner is the only visible remedy for these situations" (214).

Section: The Land Pyramid (214-220)

- Need to think in terms of a land pyramid not a "balance of nature"
- "The pyramid is a tangle of chains so / complex as to seem disorderly, yet the stability of the system proves it to be a highly organized structure. Its functioning depends on the co-operation and competition of its diverse parts" (215).
- "Land, then, is not merely soil; it is a fountain of energy flowing through a circuit of soils, plants, and animals. Food chains are the living channels which conduct energy upward; death and decay return it to the soil. The circuit is not closed; some energy is dissipated in decay, some is added by absorption from the air, some is stored in soils, peats, and long-lived forests; but it is a sustained circuit, like a slowly augmented revolving fund of life" (216).
- "Evolutionary changes, however, are usually slow and local. Man's invention of tools has enabled / him to make changes of unprecedented violence, rapidity, and scope" (217).
- "The combined evidence of history and ecology seems to support one general deduction: the less violent the man-made changes, the greater the probability of successful readjustment in the pyramid" (220).

Section: Land Health and the A-B Cleavage (221-223)

- "A land ethic, then, reflects the existence of an ecological conscience, and this in turn reflects a conviction of individual responsibility for the health of the land. Health is the capacity of the land for self-renewal. Conservation is our effort to understand and preserve this capacity" (221).
- "...a more careful scrutiny reveals a single plane of cleavage common to many specialized fields. In each field one group (A) regards the land as soil, and its function as commodity-production; another group ( B) regards the land as a biota, and its function as something broader" (221).
- "In all of these cleavages, we see repeated the same basic paradoxes: man the conqueror versus man the biotic citizen; / science the sharpener of his sword versus science the search-light on his universe; land the slave and servant versus land the collective organism" (223).

Section: The Outlook (223-226)

- "The 'key-log' which must be moved to release the evolutionary process for an ethic is simply this: quit thinking about decent land-use as solely an economic problem. Examine each question in terms of what is ethically and esthetically right, as well as what is economically expedient. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integdty, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise" (224-225).
- Super critical of conservation: "Conservation is paved with good intentions which prove to be futile, or even dangerous, because they are devoid of critical understanding either of the land,
or of economic land-use" (225).

1. The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves... These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.
2. Richness and diversity of life-forms contribute to the relation of these values and are also values in themselves.

**Groups, get ready to report back: How different is this from Leopold's Land Ethic?**

- **Would Naess classify Leopold as a shallow environmentalist? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Anything specific stand out for you in your group discussions about Naess and Deep Ecology?**

- **Anything that might help us figure out how to use this perspective in the real-world?**

<br>

I've always kind of considered Deep Ecology as Leopold on steroids.

- They build from very similar roots but reach somewhat different outcomes in terms of how aggressively to change society

- **SLIDE**: Let's now take that logic and amp it up 1000 more times...

<br>

*Naess Notes from Zotero*

Naess, A. (2005). The Deep Ecology Movement: Some Philosophical Aspects. In A. Drengson & H. Glasser (Eds.), Selected Works of Arne Naess (pp. 33–55). Springer. (Read p1-10)

- This is meant as a call for deep ecologists to make their voices heard. To stop subsuming their views or reframing them as a more shallow environmentalism (anthropocentric, land value in economic terms, conservation as strategy for growth)

- (4-7): Presents eight broad principles of deep ecology though he seems to not want to debate a precise definition for a movement. It is intentionally broad.

The Eight Principles of Deep Ecology

1. The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves (synonyms: intrinsic value, inherent value). These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.
2. Richness and diversity of life-forms contribute to the relation of these values and are also values in themselves.
3. Human beings have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs.
4. The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.
5. Current human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.
6. Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present state of affairs.
7. The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between big and great.
8. Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes. It is this principle that highlights the importance of deep questioning as the process by which to follow/develop/enact the other principles.

(7-10) Concrete examples of deep vs shallow ecology

- Pollution
- Resources
- Population
- Cultural diversity and appropriate technology
- Land and sea ethics
- Education and scientific enterprise

## Ecodefense and Monkeywrenching {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

"John Muir said that if it ever came to a war between the races, he would side with the bears. That day has arrived."

-- Dave Foreman (1993)

::: notes

**Ok, big picture first, what were your reactions to reading the intro and chapter 1 of the Ecodefense book?**

- **Had anybody been introduced to the monkeywrenching concept before this reading?**

<br>

**What did you think of Abbey's argument that violence to defend the wilderness is the same thing as violence to protect your home from attack?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: The principles of monkeywrenching

<br>

*Notes - Abbey up to p3, Foreman for Ch1*

- You have every right to defend your family and home from attack ("universally
recognized, justified and even praised by all civilized human communities"), and what little remains of the American wilderness "is now undergoing exactly such an assault" (Abbey p2)
- "Representative government in the USA represents money not people and therefore has forfeited our allegiance and moral support."
- "That wilderness is our ancestral home, the primordial homeland of all living creatures including the human, and the present final dwelling place of such noble beings as the grizzly bear, the mountain lion, the eagle and the condor, the moose and the elk and the pronghorn antelope, the redwood tree, the yellowpine, the bristlecone pine, even the aspen, and yes, why not say it?, the streams, waterfalls, rivers, the very bedrock itself of our hills, canyons, deserts, mountains" (Abbey 3).
- "No good American should ever go into the woods again without this book and, for example, a hammer and a few pounds of 60-penny nails. Spike a few trees now and then whenever you enter an area condemned to chainsaw massacre by Louisiana Pacific and its affiliated subsidiary the U.S. Forest Service. You won’t hurt the trees; they’ll be grateful for the protection; and you may save the forest" (Abbey 3).

- "In the space of a few generations we have laid waste to paradise" (Foreman 5).
- "Nonetheless, wildness and natural diversity remain. ... These are the places that hold North America together, that contain the genetic information of life, that represent sanity in a whirlwind of madness" (Foreman 5).
- "It is time for women and men, individually and in small groups, to act heroically in defense of the wild, to put a monkeywrench into the gears of the machine that is destroying natural diversity. Though illegal, this strategic monkeywrenching can be safe, easy, fun, and — most important — effective in stopping timber cutting, road building, overgrazing, oil and gas exploration, mining, dam building, powerline construction, off-road-vehicle use, trapping, ski area development, and other forms of destruction of the wilderness, as well as cancerous suburban sprawl. But it must be strategic, it must be thoughtful, it must be deliberate in order to succeed" (Foreman 6).
- "John Muir said that if it ever came to a war between the races, he would side with the bears. That day has arrived" (Foreman 8).

The principles of monkeywrenching

- Monkeywrenching is nonviolent
- Monkeywrenching is not organized
- Monkeywrenching is individual
- Monkeywrenching is targeted
- Monkeywrenching is timely
- Monkeywrenching is dispersed
- Monkeywrenching is diverse
- Monkeywrenching is fun
- Monkeywrenching is not revolutionary
- Monkeywrenching is simple
- Monkeywrenching is deliberate and ethical

::: notes

For the last part of class today I want us to reflect on the big debate that follows ecocentrism almost wherever it goes

- **Are eco-fascism and extremist tactics the inevitable result of adopting an ecocentric viewpoint or not?**

- **What was Bookchin's argument and did you find it convincing or not?**

<br>

- "Deep ecology, formulated largely by privileged male white academics..."
- Equates the "eco-brutalism" of some deep ecology proponents to the arguments Hitler made to justify his acts of genocide and "population control" (3).
- "Deep ecology is so much of a black hole of half-digested, ill-formed, and half-baked ideas that one can easily express utterly vicious notions like Foreman’s and still sound like a fiery radical who challenges everything that is anti-ecological in the present realm of ideas" (3)
- "To parody the words shallow and deep ecology is to show not only the absurdity of this vocabulary but to reveal the superficiality of its inventors. Is there perhaps a deeper ecology than deep ecology?" (3)
- "...it legitimates extremely regressive, primitivistic, and even highly reactionary notions that gain respectability because they areburied in the company of authentically radical contexts and traditions" (5-6).
- "Instead, what deep ecology gives us, apart from what it plagiarizes from radically different ideological contexts, is a deluge of Eco-la-la. Humanity surfaces in a vague and unearthly form to embrace everyone in a realm of universal guilt" (7).
- "One does not leave the muck of deep ecology without having mud all over one’s feet. Exactly who is to decide the nature of human “interference” in first nature and the extent to which it can be done? What are “some” of the ecosystems we can modify, and which ones are not subject to human “interference”?" (8)
