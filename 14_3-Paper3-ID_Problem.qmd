::: notes

We spent the first two weeks of our semester reflecting on the wilderness and our experiences of it.

- We explored Drury's campus,

- We reflected on the evolution of the word "wilderness" itself using the Nash chapter, 

- You shared with us your own personal wilderness experiences, and 

- We visited the Nature Center to get hands-on with the local environment

<br>

My hope was to use this material and these experiences to get a sense of who you are and your personal perspectives on nature before I asked you to explore the wider literature.

<br>

**Does everybody remember this spectrum concept from Nash?**

- **Remind me, what does this help us do?**

<br>

Defining the wilderness (or nature or the environment)

- Wilderness or nature is a quality, NOT a "thing"

<br>

**How does Nash define the quality of something that is purely wild?**

- (Seems to be: The absence of human influence on the environment)

**What about purely civilized?**

- (The highest levels of human intereference or shaping of the environment)

**And what are the qualities of something precisely in the middle?**

- (The middle are the rural or pastoral environment (the ploughed) that represents a balance of the forces of nature and man)

<br>

From this perspective the environment is everything around us.

- There are no distinctions to be raised about how far "environmental" concerns can reach

- The question becomes what is the quality of the environments we live in and how should we balance the wild with the civilized in all of them

- **Does that still make sense?**

<br>

**Section 2: Historical Perspectives on Wilderness**

- Edenic Narratives

- Sublime Narratives

- Utility Narratives

- Holistic Narratives

:::

::: notes

Section 2 of our class was an exploration of some of the dominant narratives in the history of the human relationship to the wilderness.

<br>

**Refresh my memory, per the Edenic perspective, what is the value of the wilderness? What is its purpose?**

- Wilderness is a resource we use to improve our lives and relieve human suffering (*Edenic Narrative*)

<br>

**Per the Sublime perspective, what is the value of the wilderness? What is its purpose?**

- Wilderness is a special place that connects us to the grandeur of the natural world (*Sublime Narrative*)

<br>

**Per the Utility perspective, what is the value of the wilderness? What is its purpose?**

- Wilderness is a resource to improve lives but must be managed so we don't run out (*Utility*)

<br>

**Per the Utility perspective, what is the value of the wilderness? What is its purpose?**

- Wilderness is NOT a resource, it is our community and we depend upon it to live (*Holistic*)

<br>

My argument to you this semester has been that you will be a more effective problem-solver in our community IF you better understand:

1. Our current debates have long historical roots,

2. Our relationship to the environment has been evolving over time, and

3. Solving real-world problems means understanding how your stakeholders view the world

<br>

**Make sense?**

<p style="color: white;">**The Environmental Justice Problem**</p>
:::

::: notes

Section 3.1 of our class focused on environmental justice

<br>

**Big picture, what is the problem we are talking about here?**

- (It appears clear from the evidence that environmental harms are not equally distributed across racial and ethnic groups in our society.)

<br>

In this section of the class we reviewed:

- The flawed and racist history of the environmental movement, 

- The empirical data on the placement of environmental harms in our country, and

- We visited two organizations working on these problems locally: Ozark's Food Harvest and the Springfield Community Gardens

<br>

**Based on the work and data from this section, how substantial would you say the environmental justice problem is in our community?**

::: notes

The final section of our class explored a ton of material on the role of capitalism as an obstacle to environmentalism

- We've been hitting this pretty hard over the last few weeks so I won't ask you to recap all of this material again!

<br>

The long and short of it was a series of arguments that:

- Capitalism compels us to consume in unsustainable ways, AND

- Capitalism is excellent at co-opting those who would push back on its impulses (e.g. environmentalism of the rich)

This last section of the class is meant to:

1. Tie all of our conceptual work this semester into the real-world once again, and

2. Represent the bridge from this course into the rest of the Designing Solutions to Environmental Problems certificate

<br>

That means asking you to identify and analyze a real-world environmental problem from our community.

**Paper 3: Analyzing a Current Environmental Problem**

<br>

Make an argument that our community needs to address an important, local environmental problem.

::: notes

The paper is due before the end of our final exam window for this class

- Dec 11th, 12:20p (Thursday)

- No late submissions can be accepted

<br>

This exercise asks you to write an argument very much like the other two papers you have written for me in this class

- The paper must advance a single thesis,

- Your thesis must be advanced by three premises,

- Each premise of the paper must be clearly explained and supported by high quality evidence, and

- You must use APA in-text citations

<br>

**Big picture, and before we talk premises, does that make sense?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: I'm going to ask you to do three things in this paper

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

Your argument must include the following **THREE** elements:

::: {.incremental}
1. Make clear the scope of the problem (e.g. who is being harmed and in what specific ways?)
2. Make clear why this problem exists (e.g. how do the actions of individuals and/or groups create this problem?)
3. Find us an example of a community anywhere in the world that has solved a problem like this, explain how they did it and what we can learn from their success.

In short, I am going to describe what exactly I want from the three premises in your paper

Paper 3: Analyzing a Current Environmental Problem

Make an argument that our community needs to address an important, local environmental problem.

Your argument must include the following THREE elements:

1. Make clear, with evidence and explanation, the scope of the problem (e.g. who is being harmed and in what specific ways?)
2. Make clear, with evidence and explanation, why this problem exists (e.g. how do the actions of individuals and/or groups create this problem?)
3. Find us an example of a community anywhere in the world that has solved a problem like this and explain how they did it and what we can learn from their success.

Please note that this is an argument paper, not an opinion piece. That means the paper must advance a single thesis (e.g. a central argument), and each component of the paper must be clearly explained and supported by high quality evidence.
