**Big picture, what is our takeaway about the "wilderness" concept from Nash's historical analysis?**

- (The wilderness is a quality of something, not a concrete thing to be identified)

<br>

**And what does that mean for us as community problem-solvers interested in environmental issues?**

- (**SLIDE**)

We have an important role to play in ALL of our environments

- Not just the ones far from civilization!

<br>

Here we see a before-and-after transformation of Main Street in Lancaster, CA [LINK](https://www.pps.org/article/road-diet-reinvigorating-downtown-lancaster-one-lane-at-a-time)

- In policy terms this is often referred to as "putting your road on a diet"

- Before: 2009

- After: 2011

<br>

Supporting the speed limit with street design transformed Main Street into Lancaster Boulevard, a safer public space, bursting with economic, social, and civic vitality.

- Pedestrian involved collisions have decreased by 78%

- Motor vehicle collisions decreased by 38%

- 57 new businesses have opened on Lancaster BLVD

- Retail sales of increased by 57%

- Revenue from the downtown area has increased 119% from 2007 to 2012

<br>

**SLIDE**: The next part of our class has focused on exploring competing historical perspectives on wilderness

**Section 2: Historical Perspectives on Wilderness**

- Edenic Narratives

- Sublime Narratives

- Utility Narratives

- Holistic Narratives

:::

::: notes

Two weeks ago we began with the Edenic narratives found in the Bible and in the descriptions of wild lands written by early American colonists and explorers.

<br>

Last week we shifted to the romantics like Thoreau, Muir and Cole who see in nature a reflection of the awesome spiritual forces in our world

<br>

As I hope I've made clear enough to you, these are not toy exercises meant to read some old books

- These competing perspectives exist in our world and can be a key to helping you solve real problems in our community.

**Can anybody tell us what a CAFO is and why they are environmental problems?**

A Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO), also known as a factory farm

- Huge efficiencies to farming at huge numbers and denying those animals much ability to move

<br>

These are why meat at the grocery store has tended to get cheaper and cheaper over time

- Huge benefits to families trying to buy groceries on fixed incomes

<br>

![](Images/05_1-McVan-hog-cafo-manure-lagoons.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

FIRST, you may object to the treatment of animals like this on ethical terms

SECOND, massive animal populations in close quarters require extensive antibiotics to stay healthy which raises the risks of antibiotic resistance spreading

THIRD, CAFOS generate millions of tons of manure every year. 

- The most common type of facility to deal with this waste is an anaerobic lagoon e.g. a giant lake of poop

- When properly managed these lagoons represent a substantial risk to the environment and public health

- They threaten groundwater, local ecosystems and damage the air quality above them

<br>

## Missouri Guardrails {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/05_1-MO_Guardrails.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Missouri Guardrails is a local nonprofit focused on protecting our water and land against uncontrolled waste releases by CAFOS

<br>

The Missouri legislature has passed laws to make regulating CAFO operations almost impossible for local communities

- Missouri Guardrails is trying to push back on this

<br>

Let's say you are trying to convince the owner of a local CAFO to spend money to reduce the harms of their CAFO on the environment

<br>

**What kinds of arguments or explanations might they give you that suggest they hold an Edenic view of the environment?**

<br>

**Given this view, what kinds of arguments can you be confident will NOT work to change this person's behavior?**

<br>

**More importantly, what kinds of arguments might have a chance to change their behavior?**

- **In other words, how do you frame a water protection argument consistent with an Edenic view of wilderness?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: The "about us" page on Missouri Guardrails is pretty good!

So, what do you think?

- **Is this a clever framing strategy for changing the minds or behavior of our hypothetical landowner? Why or why not?**

<br>

This is probably targeted more at landowners near CAFOs and not the CAFOs themselves...

Imagine you have been working to move your local community to replace its coal fired power plants with wind energy

- And yet every step of the way you are being fought, not by oil or mining intererests, but by homeowners who don't want you messing with their view of the wilderness!

- These homeowners want renewable resources just not in their backyards!

**Assuming their view of the wilderness is sublime or romantic, what kinds of arguments can you be confident will NOT work to change this person's behavior?**

##  Gifford Pinchot (1865-1946) {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/05_1-pinchot_writing){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

[National Park Service Page](https://www.nps.gov/articles/gifford-pinchot.htm)

[Forest History Society Page](https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/people/chiefs/gifford-pinchot-1865-1946/)

<br>

Gifford Pinchot, born in 1865 and died in 1946, is one of the most important early voices in American environmentalism

- Family fortune built, at least in part, on forest resources and so his lifelong interest in forests was fostered from a young age.

- His dad sent him to France to study forestry because the US had no schools of forestry at the time

<br>

Long list of accomplishments

- Helps start the Yale School of Forestry (money, money, money)

- Founds the American Society of Foresters in 1900 "to increase awareness of forestry and provide professional development opportunities for those interested in making a career of protecting woodlands."

- Was appointed the first chief of the US Forest Service in 1905 by Teddy Roosevelt

- Briefly led the National Conservation Commission (1910) performing studies on the resources of the US

- Elected governor of Pennsylvania in 1922

<br>

Also, a long list of clashes with other environmental activists of the time

- He and Muir butted heads A LOT

<br>

And why was that?

- Let's discuss the reading and see if we can guess!

- *Split class into small groups (3 per group)*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Prompt

Pinchot, G. (1910). *The Fight for Conservation*.

1. What is the wilderness?

2. What is the value of wilderness?
:::

::: notes

Groups take a few minutes to discuss the excerpts from Pinchot's book that I assigned you

- The aim is to get a sense of how Pinchot defines wilderness AND how he conceives of its value

- Be ready to report back on your conclusions and where in the text you find evidence for them

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS key elements*

- *Keep this open and encourage everyone to get involved in the discussion*

<br>

What is wilderness? 

- It is a natural resource

- **Then how is this different from the Edenic perspective?** 

    1. Longer time horizons
    2. A concern for the greatest good for the greatest number
    3. A recognition that our "resources" are limited!
    
<br>

When is wilderness valuable?

- He's obsessed with the idea that we not waste our resources

- "The first principle of conservation is development, the use of the natural resources now existing on this continent for the benefit of the people who live here now" (p10) e.g. don't extend that time horizon too far

- "In the second place conservation stands for the prevention of waste."

- "...a third principle. It is this: The natural resources must be developed and preserved for the benefit of the many, and not merely for the profit of a few" (10).

- "The central thing for which Conservation stands is to make this country the best possible place to live in, both for us and for our descendants. It stands against the waste of the natural resources which cannot be renewed, such as coal and iron; it stands for the perpetuation of the resources which can be renewed, such as the food-producing soils and the forests; and most of all it stands for an equal opportunity for every American citizen to get his fair share of benefit from these resources, both now and hereafter" (17).

<br>

Ok, groups, talk to me about Chapter 10 "An Equal Chance".

- **Does this feel like he's writing about our politics today? Any examples stand out?**

<br>

**So, based on these writings why do we think Pinchot and Muir fought over environmental protection?**

<br>

I really appreciate the USDA book tries diligently to translate the broad principles advocated by Pinchot and others into more concrete guidance for decision-making.

<br>

Let's begin by treating this like the other sources we have considered.

- **How do these authors define the wilderness?**

- (**SLIDE**: They work for the USDA so the law takes care of this for them!)

:::

::: notes

Given everything we've read and discussed so far this semester, I'd like your reflections on this definition.

- GROUPS, take a moment to discuss this definition and get ready to report back:

- **What do you like about this definition?**

- **What problems do you have with it?**

<br>

Before we dig into the principles, I want your thoughts on the paradox they discuss on p6

- **FIRST, what is the paradox?**

- (If a wilderness is an area with minimal human interference, then how can wilderness management be a thing? The minute you manage "it" you destroy "it", right?)

<br>

**And how do they sidestep the paradox?**

- ("Wilderness management is essentially the management of human use and influence to preserve naturalness and solitude" (6).)

- "Wilderness management does not need to be heavy handed. Wilderness managers are, in effect, guardians and not gardeners" (7).

- "Managers should do only what is necessary to meet wilderness objectives, and only use the minimum tools, force, and regulation required to achieve those objectives" (7).

<br>

Do we buy this?

- **SLIDE**: Let's evaluate the principles of management to see what happens when the proverbial rubber meets the road!

::: notes

Groups, take some time to discuss the principles amongst yourselves.

- Make sure everyone in your group understands what the principles suggest and have thought about what it would mean to follow or implement these as rules

<br>

Ok, groups, let's talk!

<br>

**Do these principles live up to the authors' earlier claims about wilderness management being a minimalist exercise? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Which of the principles are the clearest / easiest to adopt and follow in our comunities? Why?**

<br>

**Which of the principles would be the hardest to follow or would inspire the most opposition? Why?**

<br>

- **How would advocates of the Edenic perspective react to these principles?**

- **How would advocates of the sublime perspective react to these principles?**

<br>

**Bottom line, do we think this list of principles represents a useful set of criteria for managing wild spaces in our communities? Why or why not?**

*Images: Niagara Falls, Boston Fens, Biltmore Estate*

<br>

**Ok, how does this Spirn article fit in our work today?**

- **In other words, what is Spirn trying to show us in the work of Frederick Law Olmsted?**

<br>

Explores the legacy of Olmstead's masterful "parks" and the unforseen implications of creating the wilderness so expertly that people fail to realize they are constructed!

- Olmstead presented as the halfway point on wilderness between Muir's preservation and Pinchot's workshop. An attempt to "reconcile reverence and use" (112)

- Olmstead was very much working during the early conservation movement and trying hard to implement the ideas in practical and useful ways

- Cool case studies: Yosemite, Niagara Falls, Biltmore, the fens in Boston

- His work was double-edged. He was so good at making his work look natural that he'd run into objections from people when he tried to continue working on it (e.g. don't you dare sully that pristine wilderness that you just built for us...)

<br>

Importantly, this reinforces our key idea!

- Seeing some landscapes as natural and others as artificial is a serious problem

- Let go of the natural vs artifical distinction and instead celebrate the wild in all its forms!

<br>

**Any questions on our readings or discussions of the utility narratives today?**
