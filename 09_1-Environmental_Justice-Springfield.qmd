Tuesday we will meet at the Ozark's Food Harvest Distribution Center

- We'll get a tour of their incredible facility and the programs they are running in our community

- Very much an organization working to promote social justice and address serious environmental challenges in our community

Thursday we meet at one of the SGF Community Gardens

- They promote local sustainable food practices and community revitalization

- Plus some recent discussion of addressing the food desert problem in SGF

<br>

**Questions on our field trip?**

<br>

Ok, let's dive back into our current challenges in American environmentalism

- **SLIDE**: Last week we started with the size and scope of the environmental justice problem

[**The Environmental Justice Problem**]{style="color:white;"}
:::

::: notes

To start, define for me the problem itself

- **Big picture, what does it mean to say that we have an environmental justice problem?**

- (Inequality in the distribution of environmental harms in our society)

- Evidence that racial/ethnic minorities, less educated and poorer groups all experience more pollution than others

<br>

Last Tuesday we reviewed data and cases on this problem at the national level

- **Refresh my memory, what specific cases did you submit that show we have an unequal distribution of environmental harms?**

- *Encourage volunteers!*

<br>

Then Thursday we explored some of the historical and social scientific literatures that aim to explain why we see these outcomes

- **What are some of the mechanisms we examined to explain WHY we see this problem in practice?**

- (Kashwan (2020): Much of American environmentalism has racist historical roots)

- (Pittman (2024): Redlining was explicitly racist and pushed some groups to the periphery or to riskier areas)

- (Mildenberger (2019): Much environmental problem-solving shaped by the bad science of Garrett Hardin which promotes exploitation over management)

- (Diem (2024): Wealthy people with greater influence and resources can protect their own areas at the expense of others, e.g. NIMBYism)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our work for today is to turn our analytical focus into our own community

Big picture question: How serious is the environmental justice problem in our local community?

<br>

As a first step into answering this question let's hear the cases you submitted to Canvas!

- **What kinds of environmental justice issues are capturing media attention in our backyard?**

- *Go around the room*

<br>

Alright, let's now dig into the data sources I linked you to before class to see what we can learn about Springfield

- *Split class into small groups by the people around you; make sure they have at least one computer/table to work from*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start off by getting a sense of Springfield's demographics

<br>

Groups: Review the basic demographic information on Springfield and Greene County (Race/Ethnicity/Income) and get ready to report back: 

1) How is wealth distributed across SGF? 

2) How is race/ethnicity distributed across SGF?

<br>

**Ok, what did you find?**

- *Mirror what they describe on the screen*

<br>

Now that we have a sense of the demographic make-up of SGF, let's move to our first dataset on environmental harms

- **SLIDE**: EPA's TRI
