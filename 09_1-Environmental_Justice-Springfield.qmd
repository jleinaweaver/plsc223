Add field trip announcements to top of class




In Section 3 of our class we have begun exploring some of the current challenges in American environmentalism

- **SLIDE**: Last week we started with the size and scope of the environmental justice problem

[**The Environmental Justice Problem**]{style="color:white;"}
:::

::: notes

To start, define for me the problem itself

- **Big picture, what does it mean to say that we have an environmental justice problem?**

- (Inequality in the distribution of environmental harms in our society)

- Evidence that racial/ethnic minorities, less educated and poorer groups all experience more pollution than others

<br>

Last Tuesday we reviewed data and cases on this problem at the national level

- **Refresh my memory, what specific cases did you submit that show we have an unequal distribution of environmental harms?**

- *Encourage volunteers!*

<br>

Then Thursday we explored some of the historical and social scientific literatures that aim to explain why we see these outcomes

- **What are some of the mechanisms we examined to explain WHY we see this problem in practice?**

- (Kashwan (2020): Much of American environmentalism has racist historical roots)

- (Pittman (2024): Redlining was explicitly racist and pushed some groups to the periphery or to riskier areas)

- (Mildenberger (2019): Much environmental problem-solving shaped by the bad science of Garrett Hardin which promotes exploitation over management)

- (Diem (2024): Wealthy people with greater influence and resources can protect their own areas at the expense of others, e.g. NIMBYism)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our work for today is to turn our analytical focus into our own community

Big picture question: How serious is the environmental justice problem in our local community?

<br>

As a first step into answering this question let's hear the cases you submitted to Canvas!

- **What kinds of environmental justice issues are capturing media attention in our backyard?**

- *Go around the room*

<br>

Alright, let's now dig into the data sources I linked you to before class to see what we can learn about Springfield

- *Split class into small groups by the people around you; make sure they have at least one computer/table to work from*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start off by getting a sense of Springfield's demographics

<br>

Groups: Review the basic demographic information on Springfield and Greene County (Race/Ethnicity/Income) and get ready to report back: 

1) How is wealth distributed across SGF? 

2) How is race/ethnicity distributed across SGF?

<br>

**Ok, what did you find?**

- *Mirror what they describe on the screen*

<br>

**SLIDE**: EPA's TRI

Groups, get ready to report back

- **What are the strengths and weaknesses of using the EPA's toxic release inventory for measuring environmental justice in our community?**

- Think in terms of where their data comes from, how it is measured and whether it is audited for possible errors

- Go!

<br>

Ok, groups, now focus on using this data to evaluate Springfield and our surrounding communities (or your group's home town).

- **What do we learn about your community from using these maps? Are the toxic releases correlated 



Do we need data on wealth, poverty or race by place BEFORE examining the pollution?




- What is it? How is it measured? How much uncertainty?
- Small groups: What do we learn about SGF from these maps?
3. City of SGF's brownfields
- What are they? How measured? How much uncertainty?
- Small groups: What do we learn about SGF from these maps?
4. American Forests' tree equity score
- What is it? How measured? How much uncertainty?
- Small groups: What do we learn about SGF from these maps?
5. RAND redlining maps
- What is it? 
- How much do these redlines mirror the other data we've explored?
6. Let's add to all of these the cases you submitted to Canvas
- Circle up and introduce each case
7. Given the evidence, the question becomes, what do we do about this?
