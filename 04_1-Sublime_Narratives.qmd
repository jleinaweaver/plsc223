**Big picture, what is our takeaway about the "wilderness" concept from Nash's historical analysis?**

- (The wilderness is a quality of something, not a concrete thing to be identified)

<br>

**In the spectrum, how does Nash define "purely civilized"?**

- (meaning the highest levels of human interference or shaping of the environment)

<br>

**And how does Nash define the "purely wild"?**

- (meaning the absence of human influence on the environment)

<br>

**And what does Cronon argue is our important takeaway from recognizing all of this?**

- (**SLIDE**)

## {background-image="Images/03_2-tree_lined_street_v2.png" .center}

### [We must abandon "the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial...and the tree in the wilderness as natural... Both trees in some ultimate sense are wild; both in a practical sense now depend on our management and care" (Cronon 1996, 24).]{style="color:white;"}

::: notes

Caring about the wilderness means feeling responsible for EVERY environment

- We can, and probably should, foster some wildness in all our outdoor environments!

<br>

So, don't get bogged down in debates about what is or isn't natural, focus on what you can do to promote wilderness everywhere

<br>

**SLIDE**: Applying the scale is hard in practice

### Why is it so hard to rate the SGF Conservation Nature Center on a scale of 0 (purely civilized) to 10 (purely wild)?

![](Images/03_1-Nature_Center2.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

**Why was it so hard for us to classify the SGF Conservation Nature Center on a scale of 0 (purely civilized) to 10 (purely wild)?**

<br>

The ratings exercise depends on which elements you choose as most important and which to ignore

- Everyone has a different perspective on what wilderness is and how it should be valued

- Put differently, placement on the scale depends on making clear your assumptions

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's use the Edenic perspective AS our assumptions for this exercise!

:::



## {background-image="Images/04_1-Cole_Thomas_Expulsion_from_the_Garden_of_Eden_1828.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Here we see Thomas Cole's famous painting, Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (1828)

- Adam and Eve are being thrust into the most unforgiving looking wilderness we can imagine

<br>

**Compare and contrast Eden and the wilderness here for me**

- **How specifically are they different?**

<br>

*FOR FALL 2026*

**Remind me, how does Eden compare to the wilderness in this story?**

<br>

**So, if I asked you to adopt the Edenic perspective on wilderness, what would that mean you need to focus on?**

<br>

The Edenic perspective views wilderness as:

1. A place without God e.g. a place of temptation, suffering and danger, and

2. A place that exists to serve the needs of humanity

<br>

This implies to me that maximizing human control requires:

1. economic exploitation of the resources, and 

2. human dominance of everything we find out "there"

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, so now let's answer the reframed question

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

### Using the Edenic perspective on wilderness rate the SGF Conservation Nature Center on a scale from 0 (purely civilized) to 10 (purely wild)?

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 6, fig.height=1.25}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Purely\nCivilized", "Purely\nWild")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.9, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow(ends = "both"))
```

::: notes

**What is your rating of the SGF Conservation Nature Center if you adopt the Edenic perspective on wilderness?**

<br>

To me, this perspective would view the SGF Conservation Nature Center on the wilderness side of the mid-point on the scale

- There is extensive control and management by man, and

- The area is widely used for human recreation, BUT

- The allowable list of uses is HEAVILY proscribed

- Pushing the Nature Center to the other end of the spectrum would require widening the list of allowable exploitation activities

<br>

**You guys buying this application?**

- **Does it make sense how one's position on the scale depends on other key assumptions?**

<br>

THIS is one of the big reasons we spend these early weeks exploring and reflecting on the perspectives

- Each different perspective is a shortcut to understanding the debates about the environment we see around us today

<br>

**SLIDE**: With that in mind, let's talk about our evidence of the Edenic narrative in the world around us

:::



## {background-image="Images/04_1-2024_Subaru_Compact_SUV_desert_xl.png" .center}

::: notes

Nothing says AI generated freedom like watching a car drive through a wilderness!

<br>

**Give me specific examples of this perspective in our consumer lives (e.g. products or services for sale)**

<br>

**Give me specific examples of this perspective in our political discourse**

<br>

**Which kinds of Edenic arguments do you find most compelling? Why?**

<br>

**What are the benefits of adopting this perspective?**

- **In other words, if society decided this was the "correct" lens for making resource decisions, who would benefit? How?**

- (Might maximize short term growth and provide immediate economic benefits to society)

<br>

**Contra those, what are the dangers to society decided this was the "correct" lens for making resource decisions?**

- (ecological catastrophe, long-term risk)

<br>

**Anything I didn't mention about this perspective you want to make sure we keep in mind moving forward?**

- Edenic Narratives

- Sublime Narratives

- Utility Narratives

- Holistic Narratives

:::

::: notes

This week we shift to our next perspective: The Sublime Narrative of Wilderness

- I suspect many of you will feel great affinity for this perspective

- Very appealing intuitions

- I was able to assign you excerpts for today from some of my favorite writers about the natural experience

<br>

It can be hard to have a seminar style chat with this many people so we'll do a mix of group pre-work and class discussion

- *Split class into small groups (3 per group)*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's begin with Thoreau's climb up Mount Katadin!

:::



## {background-image="Images/04_1-Mount_Katahdin.jpg" .center}

::: notes

**Has anybody visited Mount Katahdin in Maine?**

<br>

Mount Katahdin

- Translates to "Greatest Mountain" in Penobscot

- Is the highest mountain in the state of Maine at 5,269 feet

- Considered sacred by the Maliseet, Micmac, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot nations

<br>

**SLIDE**: Prompts

Thoreau, H. D. (1906). *The Maine Woods*.

1. What is the wilderness?

2. What is the value of wilderness?
:::

::: notes

Henry David Thoreau is a towering figure in the American intellectual history of the wilderness and nature

- **Has anybody read any of his classic *Walden*?**

- (A very dry read, but important nontheless...)


<br>

Groups take a few minutes to discuss the excerpt from Henry David Thoreau's *The Main Woods* that recounts his climbing of Mount Katahdin

- The aim is to get a sense of how Thoreau defines wilderness AND how he conceives of its value

- Be ready to report back on your conclusions and where in the text you find evidence for them

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS key elements*

- *Keep this open and encourage everyone to get involved in the discussion*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, don't lose sight of this, but now let's jump to the Muir piece.

:::



## {background-image="Images/04_1-Sierra_Nevada_Mountains.jpg" .center}

::: notes

**Has anybody visited the Sierra Nevada mountains in California and Nevada?**

<br>

The Sierra Nevada mountains

- Massive mountain range (400 miles long, 50-80 miles wide)

- The Sierra is home to three national parks, twenty-six wilderness areas, ten national forests, and two national monuments. 

- These areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks, as well as Devils Postpile National Monument.

Muir, J. (1917). *My First Summer in the Sierra: Vol. II*

1. What is the wilderness?

2. What is the value of wilderness?
:::

::: notes

You simply cannot write a history of American environmentalism without considering the role of John Muir.

- Founder of the Sierra Club in 1892

- Led the battle to preserve the Hetch-Hetchy valley

- And so much more...

<br>

Groups take a few minutes to discuss the excerpt from Muir's diary from exploring the Sierra Nevadas

- The aim is to get a sense of how Muir defines wilderness AND how he conceives of its value

- Be ready to report back on your conclusions and where in the text you find evidence for them

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS key elements*

- *Keep this open and encourage everyone to get involved in the discussion*

<br>

**SLIDE**: On to Thomas Cole's essay on the wilderness

:::



## {background-image="Images/04_1-Thomas_Cole_Landscape.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Thomas Cole (February 1, 1801 – February 11, 1848) was an American artist and the founder of the Hudson River School art movement.

- Cole used his art to explore themes of nature's spiritual power, the impact of industrialization on the landscape, and humanity's complex relationship with the wilderness.

- His *Essay on American Scenery* is a powerful argument for the preservation of American wilderness

Alright groups, let's do this one more time

- The aim is to get a sense of how Cole defines wilderness AND how he conceives of its value

- Be ready to report back on your conclusions and where in the text you find evidence for them

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS key elements*

- *Keep this open and encourage everyone to get involved in the discussion*

Ok, sum this all up for me.

- **What are the assumptions you accept if you adopt the sublime perspective on wilderness?**

<br>

- Wilderness is terrifying, but in a good way!

- The value of wilderness is in its alien / non-human nature

- We enter it as pilgrims ready to be dominated and awestruck

<br>

**SLIDE**: And then the rating exercise

```

::: notes

Groups, discuss your answers to Canvas Q1 and get ready to report back

- **What is your rating of the SGF Conservation Nature Center if you adopt the sublime perspective on wilderness?**

- (The Edenic narrative sees the Center as a wilder place)

- (The sublime narrative sees a Lowes garden center)

    - A nature completely dominated by our hand
    
    - A nature made completely "safe"

<br>

**From the sublime perspective, is the Springfield Conservation Nature Center a good use of wilderness? Why or why not?**

- (Maybe. It is better than nothing)

- (BUT, this ain't the wilderness and visiting it will not do for us what these writers believed we need to have happen to open our minds, hearts and souls)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Finally, how does Denevan's (1992) argument impact the sublime narrative?

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

Denevan, W. (1992). "The Pristine Myth: The Landscape of the Americas in 1492." *Annals of the Association of American Geographers*. 82 (1992): 369-85.

<br>

How does Denevan's (1992) argument impact your understanding of the sublime perspective on wilderness and nature? 

- Does it contradict the views of Thoreau, Muir and Cole, reinforce them, or do something else?

::: notes

Groups, discuss your answers to Canvas assignment Q2 and get ready to report back!

- *Your Denevan notes at bottom*

- *Report back and discuss*

<br>

**Are we clear on what precisely Denevan is arguing?**

- (Human beings have ALWAYS modified our environments to survive and thrive)

- "By 1492, Indian activity had modified vegetation and wildlife, caused erosion, and created earthworks, roads, and settlements through-out the Americas. This may be obvious, but the human imprint was much more ubiquitous and enduring than is usually realized."

<br>

**Why might the writers and painters in the sublime narrative group see a pristine wilderness when they look outside?**

- (Because we had wiped out the native populations)

- "Equally important, most of our eyewitness descriptions of wilderness and empty lands come from a later time, particularly 1750-1850 when interior lands began to be explored and occupied by Europeans. By 1650, Indian populations in the hemisphere had been reduced by about 90 percent, while by 1750 European numbers were not yet substantial and settlement had only begun to expand. As a result, fields had been abandoned, while settlements vanished, forests recovered, and savannas retreated. The landscape did appear to be a sparsely populated wilderness" (379).

<br>

**Per the historical record, has there ever been a "purely wild" wilderness once humans reached it?**

- “The human impact on environment is not simply a process of increasing change or degradation in response to linear population growth and economic expansion. It is instead interrupted by periods of reversal and ecological rehabilitation as cultures collapse, populations decline, wars occur, and habitats are abandoned. Impacts may be constructive, benign, or degenerative (all subjective concepts), but change is continual at variable rates and in different directions. Even mild impacts and slow changes are cumulative, and the long-term effects can be dramatic. Is it possible that the thousands of years of human activity before Columbus created more change in the visible landscape than has occurred subsequently with European settlement and resource exploitation? The answer is probably yes for most regions for the next 250 years or so, and for some regions right up to the present time” (381).

<br>

**SLIDE**: Assignment for next class

<br>

*Notes from Denevan (1992)*

- Romanticist and primativist writers like Hudson, Cooper, thoreau, Longfellow, Parkman and painters like Caitline and Church advocated a pristine view of America as a "sparsely populated wilderness, 'a world of barely perceptible human disturbance'" (369).

- "To the contrary, the Indian impact was neither benign nor localized and ephemeral, nor were resources always used in a sound ecological way" (370).

- "The evidence is convincing. By 1492 Indian activity throughout the Americas had modified forest extent and composition, created and expanded grasslands, and rearranged microrelief via countless artificial earthworks. Agricultural fields were common, as were houses and towns and roads and trails. All of these had local impacts on soil, microclimate, hydrology, and wildlife" (370).

- Interestingly, "the Indian landscape of 1492 had largely vanished by the mid-eighteenth century, not through a European superimposition, but because of the demise of the native population. The landscape of 1750 was more 'pristine' (less humanized) than that of 1492" (370).

- "Indian Numbers" (370) were substantial in 1492 (e.g. 40-100 million in the hemisphere! Denevan suspects a tighter range of 43-65 million)

- "Vegetation: The Eastern Forests" (371): Indian burning of forests for agriculture and ease of hunting creates a forest with wide broken up areas of grassy lowlands. This remains a point of controversy in academia.

- "Vegetation: Forest Composition" (372): Fire extensively alters forest composition. Example: 'Fire created conditions favorable to strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and other gatherable foods (Cronon 1983).'

- "Vegetation: Midwest Prairies and Tropical Savannas" (372)

- "Vegetation: Anthropegnic Tropical Rain Forest" (373): Evidence of fires plus "manipulation of swidden fallows (sequential agroforestry) to increase useful species. "The planting, transplanting, sparing, and protection of useful wild, fallow plants eliminates clear distinctions between field and fallow (Denevan and Padoch 1988)."

- "Wildlife" (375): Evidence remains controversial, but forest composition changes did seems to increase the range and amount of useful creatures that impressed the colonists so much about the new world.

- "Agriculture" (375): "Fields and Associated Features", "Erosion"

- "The Built Landscape" (376): "Settlement", "Mounds", "Roads, Causeways and Trails"

- "Recovery" (377): "A strong case can be made for significant environmental recovery and reduction of cultural features by the late eighteenth century as a result of Indian population decline." ... "Wildlife also partially recovered in eastern North America with reduced hunting pressure from Indians; however, this is also a story yet to be worked out" (378).

- "Conclusions" (379)

- "By 1492, Indian activity had modified vegetation and wildlife, caused erosion, and created earthworks, roads, and settlements through-out the Americas. This may be obvious, but the human imprint was much more ubiquitous and enduring than is usually realized."

- "The weight of evidence suggests that Indian populations were large..."

- "The roots of the pristine myth lie in part with early observers unaware of human impacts that may be obvious to scholars today, particularly for vegetation and wildlife."

- "Equally important, most of our eyewitness descriptions of wilderness and empty lands come from a later time, particularly 1750-1850 when interior lands began to be explored and occupied by Europeans. By 1650, Indian populations in the hemisphere had been reduced by about 90 percent, while by 1750 European numbers were not yet substantial and settlement had only begun to expand. As a result, fields had been abandoned, while settlements vanished, forests recovered, and savannas retreated. The landscape did appear to be a sparsely populated wilderness."

- "The human impact on environment is not simply a process of increasing change or degradation in response to linear population growth and economic expansion. It is instead interrupted by periods of reversal and ecological rehabilitation as cultures collapse, populations decline, wars occur, and habitats are abandoned. Impacts may be constructive, benign, or degenerative (all subjective concepts), but change is continual at variable rates and in different directions.
