<br>

### What's going on in the world of environmental problems or policy?

::: {.fragment}
1. What happened?

2. Why should we care about it?

3. Why is this an "environmental" issue?
:::

::: notes

Everybody pull out your phone / tablet / laptop and go find me a current event that we would consider "environmental" in some way

- Go!

<br>

**Everybody got something?**

- Ok, get ready to report back to us on what you found using these three prompts

- **REVEAL**

1. What is the specific thing being reported? e.g. what happened?

2. Why should we care about it?

3. Why is this an environmental issue? Define the concept

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

- Go!

<br?

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

4. PLSC, Certificate or Explorations?
:::

::: notes

This class is almost always a quirky collection of backgrounds and interests!

- Some of you are here for the environment Fusion certificate, 

- Some are here to meet a Fusion Exploration requirement, and

- Some are poli sci or environmental biology majors

<br>

So, let's go around the room for introductions (and attendance).

<br>

I'll go first.

1. I'm Dr. Justin Leinaweaver.

2. FSU undergrad, masters in IR at UCD and PhD at Trinity.
    - My fourteenth year at Drury

3. I'm a political scientist
    - Research interests: international policymaking, environmental politics and bargaining / negotiations.
  
4. I'm the director of the Solving Environmental Problems certificate

<br>

**Your turn**

<br>

**SLIDE**: For those of you not here for the certificate, let me quickly pitch you on it

**Designing Solutions for Environmental Problems**

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Required Courses**

- PLSC 223 The Individual, Society and the Environment

- BIOL 163 Science of the Environment

- ECON 225 Introduction to Environmental Economics

- PLSC 323 Issues in Environmental Policy

:::

::: notes

So, this class is the intro for the "Designing Solutions for Environmental Problems" Fusion Certificate.

- This is a "professional" certificate means to help you quickly develop the background and skills needed to make a concrete difference in your community

<br>

Our argument to you is that successfully solving environmental problems requires an understanding of:

- the community that faces the problem,

- the science of the problem,

- the economics of the problem, and

- the tools of good policy design.

<br>

If anybody has questions on the certificate I'm happy to meet and discuss.

<br>

Everybody log on to our class canvas page and let's talk about our semester 

<br>

Home page

- Catalog description

- LOs

- Instructor info and my contact info

<br>

**SLIDE**: Go to the syllabus page

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/01_1-Canvas_Syllabus.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Syllabus is our contract for the class

- All the key details are in it

<br>

Grades breakdown

- Participation is 55% of the grade (daily assignments)

- Three papers are 45%

<br>

- Attendance Policy

    - Attendance cliff after three unexcused absences ("C")
    
    - If you will be missing class for an excusable reason (e.g. documented medical issues, school mandated absences) **YOU** must email me before the absence in order to receive a make-up assignment.
    
    - Coach emails do not replace YOUR responsibility to contact me
    
    - Participation: You earn participation points by being on time to class, being engaged during class (e.g., having all needed materials, not distracting others, etc.), and submitting all required daily assignments on Canvas BEFORE class begins.
    
<br>

Syllabus also has

- Paper submission requirements

- Argument paper rubric I use for grading

- Provisional semester outline, and

- Drury University policies on plagiarism, Title IX and Disability Support services

<br>

We will be getting out of the classroom at times this semester. 

- **Does everyone have a car?**

- If not please let me know and we will figure out carpooling for those trips.

<br>

**SLIDE**: The AI policy

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/01_1-No_AI_Tools.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

You may not use any AI tools in this class. Any AI use will be treated as plagiarism.

<br>

That means: 

- No AI search

- No AI summaries of articles or books

- No AI for outlining or writing

- No AI for data analysis

- No AI to simply clean up your grammar (e.g. Grammarly).

<br>

Think of this class like training to play a sport

- The time you spend in the gym getting stronger and more flexible makes you a better athlete regardless of the sport you end up playing. 

- That's what we're doing in this class when we learn to critically analyze texts and become better writers.

- I'm getting you ready to succeed out in the real world

- Using AI tools is like bringing a forklift into the weight room. Yeah, you lifted the weights, but it was a waste of your time.

<br>

Other key point: Lots of people are worried about AI taking their jobs, e.g. replacing them in the workforce. 

- If you use AI to do your thinking for you then you are literally replacing yourself with AI

- You are setting yourself up with skills that are basically without value

<br>

So, let's not waste this opportunity working together this semester

- Let's get stronger and be better adapted to whatever the world looks like when you graduate

<br>

**Questions on this policy?**

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

![](Images/01_1-Canvas_Modules.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Finally, everybody go to the modules page.

<br>

This has almost everything you need to succeed in this class this semester!

- All readings posted (or linked)

- All Canvas daily assignments

    - REMEMBER you must complete these BEFORE class to earn credit!

<br>

**Any questions on the Modules page or what is listed here?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Everybody click on the pre-class assignment listed for Thursday and let's get to work!

:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-Drury_Campus.jpeg" .center}

::: notes

To help kick off our class we need to see what your prior understandings of the environment look like.

- I'm asking for you to explore our campus a bit and to report back on what you find.

- Three photos each in response to a specific prompt alongside an explanation of your reasoning.

<br>

**Any questions on the prompts themselves?**

<br>

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is NOT a reviewing the research exercise (yet).

- Don't google the concepts first. 

- I want your work to reflect your current understanding of the concepts.

- This is not an attempt to represent or illustrate some common, external definition.

<br>

**Does that make sense?**

- Your intuition + life experience will have led you to this moment and your current understanding of the world

- I want your photos to reflect THAT understanding.

<br>

Go to work and I'll see you Thursday

<br>

Canvas Assignment: Reflecting on our Backyard

1. Take a photo of something on Drury's campus that you believe represents the wilderness or nature in its purest form. Include the photo and 2+ sentences explaining your selection.

2. Take a photo of something on campus that represents wilderness or nature in a slightly lesser form (e.g. still natural, but being managed or controlled). Include the photo and 2+ sentences explaining your selection.

3. Take a photo of something on campus that is clearly NOT an example of the wilderness or nature in any form. Include the photo and 2+ sentences explaining your selection.
