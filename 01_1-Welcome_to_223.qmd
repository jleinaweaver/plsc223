**The Most Important Environmental Problems**

- Local?

- National?

- Global?
:::

::: notes

*Split class into three parts based on where they are sitting*

<br>

Groups, introduce yourselves to each other and start making three lists on the board

- What are currently the most important environmental problems we face at the global, national and local levels?

- By the way, "climate change" is not a specific enough answer for these lists
    - Climate change is a magnifier of other problems, list the specific problems

<br>

*Share lists and discuss*

- How are you defining "important"?

- "Who" matters most according to your list?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Introductions

:::



## Introductions {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
1. Name

2. Year in school

3. Major

4. Enrolled in the Environment Certificate?
:::

::: notes

This class is almost always a quirky collection of backgrounds and interests!

- Some of you are here for the environment Fusion certificate, and

- Some are poli sci or environmental biology majors

<br>

So, let's go around the room for introductions (and attendance).

<br>

I'll go first.

1. I'm Dr. Justin Leinaweaver.

2. FSU undergrad, masters in IR at UCD and PhD at Trinity.
    - My thirteenth year at Drury

3. I'm a political scientist
    - Research interests: international policymaking, environmental politics and bargaining / negotiations.
  
4. I'm the director of the certificate

<br>

**Your turn**

The "Science of the Environment" class was designed to enable you to identify the scientific basis of environmental problems (see certificate LOs).

**Designing Solutions for Environmental Problems**

<br>

**Required Courses**

- BIOL 163 Science of the Environment

- ECON 225 Introduction to Environmental Economics

- PHIL 320 Environmental Ethics

- **PLSC 323 Issues in Environmental Policy**

::: notes

That brings us to the capstone experience, e.g. this class!

- In here we bring the politics and policy to the table.

<br>

In other words, given the science, the economics and the ethics of a given environmental problem, what can we feasibly do to address it?
:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1.png"}

::: notes

Given our large number of non-majors we should take a moment to define a key concept in our class: Politics

**Non-majors, when you think of the word "politics" what do you think of?**

- **Is it compromise, good faith and teamwork?**

<br>

**When we describe someone as "political" what are we saying about them?**

- **Is it a flattering description?**

<br>

The word politics these days is often attached to awful behavior by self-serving morons.

- That is decidedly not what we study in political science

- Or, that is not the only thing we study in political science

<br>

**SLIDE**: Rather than start with a technical definition, let's simulate a political problem related to the environment and see if that clears things up

:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**What explains the outcome of our game?**
:::

::: notes

Everybody take a moment to reflect on our game.

- Get ready to explain, from your perspective, what just happened?

<br>

**Bottom line, why did we end up with the outcome of the game that we did?**

- **Biggest reason(s) in your mind?**

<br>

1. **Did everyone in class have the same goals?**

2. **Did making rules as a community help? Why or why not?**

3. **Did you worry much about compliance with the rules? Why or why not?**

4. **Did you care about the survival of the fishery? Why or why not?**

<br>

Games and simulations are often a useful tool for exploring politics.

- What we just played was a fairly basic resource distribution game.

- It highlights a ton of important stuff, but let me know draw out a few important ideas

<br>

**SLIDE**: Standard definitions of politics...
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**1. Decision-making in a community**
:::

::: notes

One way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **how groups make decisions**.

- Group decision-making is complex and multi-layered

- It is also one of the **fundamental building blocks** of our society 

<br>

I set a fairly simple rule in your game, a majority vote.

- But that is FAR from the only way we could have done it! 
:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**2. How we make and enforce "the rules"**
:::

::: notes

A second way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **the rules**.

- Once a society has established rules, many political scientists study how those rules are interpreted, revised and enforced

- **The decision to punish a rule-breaker is a huge decision** that often sends ripples out through a community

<br>

**Out of curiosity, what would happen if today SGF police started pulling over EVERY car that exceeded the speed limit by even 1 mph?**

- **Seriously, walk me through how our community changes and reacts to that change in policy.**

<br>

**And what would happen if they completely stopped enforcing speed limits?**

- **Again, walk me through how our community changes and reacts to that change in policy.**

:::


## {background-image="Images/01_1-politics1_v1.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**3. Who gets what, when and how?**
:::

::: notes

A third way that we study "politics" is by focusing on **the distribution of costs and benefits**.

<br>

Why do groups form? 

- Often it is **to produce greater resources** than any individual could do on their own

    - This could be money, food, a division of labor, or collective security

- HOWEVER, producing that good means **someone has to pay** and someone has to benefit

<br>

Who pays and who benefits is **a constant tension** in any society.

<br>

Bottom line, anytime a group of people have to come together to make a decision, a political scientist can be found who is interested in the process.

- **Any questions on this broad definition of the concept "politics"?**

```

::: notes

And that brings us to our primary aim in this class: 

- Our big goal this semester is to find a local environmental problem, learn a ton about it and then try to make a difference in it

<br>

I mean this. 

- My ambition is that we get out into the world and get something done.

- Will we succeed? Who knows! But let's give it a shot!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's wrap up today by touching base on my expectations for the course

::: notes

Everyone should download and read the syllabus.

- Tons of important course policies in there and by taking this class you are agreeing to all of them

<br>

Since this capstone class has ambitions of getting out into the world and making a difference, I need you all to come to class and be engaged

- We're only going to get as far as you're willing to push.

- The attendance and participation policies are meant to help motivate you!

<br>

Half your course grade this semester is about showing up, being prepared and engaging in the work of our class.

- You'll see on the Modules page of Canvas that most of our class sessions have a reading plus an assignment

- To get credit you must submit these assignments BEFORE class begins.

<br>

There is an attendance cliff in this class

- Anyone with more than three unexcused absences in the semester cannot earn higher than a ‘C’ in the course (regardless of grades earned on other assignments).

- IFF you have an excused absence coming up **YOU** are required to contact me by email for excused absences
    
    - Coach emails alone DO NOT COUNT

<br>

The other half of your grade will consist of reports presenting your analyses and action plans for our selected environmental problem

- More to come on that soon.

<br>

**Any questions on these grades or policies?**

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: notes

1. Cronon 1996, "The Trouble with Wilderness or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature"

2. Canvas Assignment
    
    1. According to Cronon (1996), why is "the wilderness" a serious problem for environmental problem-solving? Explain the thesis of the article (2+ sentences)
    
    2. What is the strongest piece of evidence provided by Cronon in the article? (2+ sentences)
    
    3. If Cronon (1996) is correct, what do we need to do in order to engage productively in environmental problem-solving in our community? (2+ sentences)

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>
