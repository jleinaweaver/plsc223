4. How do we get involved?

::: notes

To wrap up our work last week I asked each of you to find us examples of groups doing important work on environmental justice problems in our area

- Let's take a minute to hear about what you found and how we can help!

- *Go around the room to hear the cases*

<br>

Alright, sum this all up for me

- **How many different ways can we get involved on these issues in our community? What can we do?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our next big challenge to American environmentalism

::: notes

By capitalism I mean an economic system broadly defined by:

- Private (not public) ownership of the means of production, 
    
- A primary motivating focus on the pursuit of profit, and 
    
- The existence of free markets where prices are set by supply and demand

<br>

Our capitalist system does some things really well like:

- Generating wealth, 

- Allocating resources, and 

- Promoting efficiency

<br>

HOWEVER, we also do some things terribly

- Massive levels of income inequality,

- Serious environmental harms pushed onto the poorest amongst us,

- Incentives to capture the government in order to direct business to yourself

- etc.

<br>

So the next section of our class focuses on capitalism as a challenge for American environmentalism

<br>

**SLIDE**: To get into this section, let's talk about your role as a consumer

**Reflecting on our Behavior as Consumers**
:::

<br>

What are the specific decisions you make, things you buy or actions you take on a somewhat regular basis that have the biggest negative impact on the environment?

::: notes

For today I asked each of you to reflect on your role in this system

- Important: This is not an exercise in being judgmental and I am definitely not looking for you to be defensive. 

- The aim here is to identify a series of choices we know are sub-optimal for the environment AND to better understand what leads us to make them.

<br>

Let's go around the room to hear about your lives as consumers!

- Go!

<br>

Ok, let's talk about what we've just heard

- **Are we all making similar "bad" choices? How much overlap did you hear across the cases?**

- **Are we all providing the same kinds of justifications for our "bad" actions?**

<br>

Think about all you've heard and tell me:

- **What kinds of things could we do to nudge each of you to make better choices?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Plan in this subsection

<br>

Canvas Assignment: Reflecting on our Behavior as Consumers

What are the specific decisions you make, things you buy or actions you take on a somewhat regular basis that have the biggest negative impact on the environment? If you know that they are harmful, why do you continue to do them? 

- Note: This is not an exercise in being judgmental and I am definitely not looking for you to be defensive. The aim here is to identify a series of choices we know are sub-optimal for the environment AND to better understand what leads us to make them.

::: notes

Over the next few weeks I want us to explore the capitalist system as we have implemented it and the ways it can go very wrong for the environment

- In short, our system seems set up to encourage us to make choices that harm the environment. 

- The question is, can we do better?

<br>

Specifically, in this section we'll explore:

- An American environmental catastrophe, e.g. the "Dust Bowl", 
    
- The effects of globalization or the spread of capitalism around the world, 
    
- The fight by groups who want to protect the "under-valued" resources, e.g. more on eco-terrorism!, and 
    
- Finally an argument that capitalism has corrupted environmentalism

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's kick things off with our American environmental catastrophe: the Dust Bowl.

Clip package 1 (Episode 1)

- 0:00 - 5:07 (5 mins): sets up the whole thing

- 7:52 - 17:00 (9 mins): Nature's balance invites use

<br>

Remember, our focus in this section of the class is on capitalism as a challenge to American environmentalism

- **What is Ken Burns' argument so far about our capitalist system and its view of our resources / the wilderness?**

- (Nature's balance invited our use)
- Nature took a long time to find this balance of wind and the importance of the native grasses
- Congress enlarges Homestead Act and attracts many, many new homesteaders
- Plenty of rain + new public lands for sale leads to capitalist explosion!
- WWI makes wheat super valuable

<br>

Clip package 2 (Episode 1)

- 17:32 - 23:15 (6 mins)

<br>

**Ok, what is the argument being teased in this clip about our relationship to nature?**

- (Capitalism as Edenic narrative and Edenic use leads to exploitation!)
- Immigrants seeking to OWN the land
- Modern machinery is great for profit! 
- Farm as factory. 
- Suitcase farmers. 
- Government claims we could never use up the soil!

<br>

And where does all of this end up?

Clip package 3 (Episode 1)

- 32:49 - 36:11 (4 mins): Jump ahead to preview the dust storms

<br>

1. Read excerpts from Worster's (1979) *Dust Bowl*

    - Chapter 3 (p44-63)
    - Chapter 5 (p80-98)
    - Chapter 14 (p210-230)

2. Submit **at least three** key premises to Canvas

::: notes

Worster's book is an extended history of the Dust Bowl and an argument that capitalism is the cause of this environmental catastrophe.

<br>

Your job is to read these three chapters in order to help us identify the key premises in this argument

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Capitalism and the Dust Bowl

Worster's book is an extended history of the Dust Bowl and an argument that capitalism is the cause of this environmental catastrophe.

Read chapters 1, 5 and 14 then submit AT LEAST THREE premises from Worster's argument (e.g. reasons Worster argues that the Dust Bowl was caused by our capitalist system).

- Include the page numbers for each premise (for ease of reference in class).
