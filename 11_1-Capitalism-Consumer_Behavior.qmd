::: notes

To wrap up our work last week I asked each of you to find us examples of groups doing important work on environmental justice problems in our area

- Let's take a minute to hear about what you found and how we can help!

- *Go around the room to hear the cases*

<br>

Ok, key takeaways?

- **Do we have many groups doing good work in our community? Where can we plug into their work?**

<br>

Alright, the next section of our class will focus on capitalism as a challenge for American environmentalism

- **SLIDE**: To get into this section, let's talk about your role as a consumer

<br>

Canvas DISCUSSION: Efforts to Promote Environmental Justice in Springfield

Find us a group of any kind, other than those we are visiting this week, who are actively working to address environmental justice issues in southwest Missouri. No overlapping groups, first-come, first-served. 

Submit:

1. The name of the group and a link to their website or where more information about them can be found,
2. Explain the problem they are targeting and why it is an issue of environmental justice (2+ sentences)
3. Explain the actions they are taking to address this problem (3+ sentences)
4. Provide us different options for getting involved with this group or in helping them with their actions (3+ sentences)

**Reflecting on our Behavior as Consumers**
:::

<br>

What are the specific decisions you make, things you buy or actions you take on a somewhat regular basis that have the biggest negative impact on the environment?

::: notes

Let's go around the room to hear about your lives as consumers!

<br>

Let's talk about what we've just heard

- **How much overlap in what we've just heard? Are we all making similar "bad" choices?**

<br>

**Per these cases, what are the best predictors of "bad" environmental choices?**

<br>

**Does this argument suggest promising ways to encourage individuals like us to make better choices? How specifically?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Plan in this subsection

<br>

Canvas Assignment: Reflecting on our Behavior as Consumers

What are the specific decisions you make, things you buy or actions you take on a somewhat regular basis that have the biggest negative impact on the environment? If you know that they are harmful, why do you continue to do them? 

- Note: This is not an exercise in being judgmental and I am definitely not looking for you to be defensive. The aim here is to identify a series of choices we know are sub-optimal for the environment AND to better understand what leads us to make them.

Moving forward in class: The system itself is set up to encourage us to make choices that harm the environment. 

- Over the next few weeks I want us to explore the system and the ways it can go very wrong

- Specifically we'll explore:

    - An American catastrophe (the "Dust Bowl"), 
    
    - The effects of globalization, 
    
    - The dangers of eco-terrorism, and 
    
    - Finally an argument that capitalism has corrupted environmentalism

<br>

So, let's kick things off with an American environmental catastrophe: the Dust Bowl. 

- *Watch some of the Dust Bowl documentary (Episode 1) as setup for next class*

- *Show them the first 23 minutes of Episode 1*

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next class

<br>

OLD PLAN

- 0:00 - 5:07 (5 mins): sets up the whole thing

- 7:52 - 17:00 (9 mins)  

    - Nature took a long time to find this balance of wind and the importance of the native grasses
    - Congress enlarges Homestead Act and attracts many, many new homesteaders
    - Plenty of rain + new public lands for sale leads to capitalist explosion!
    - WWI makes wheat super valuable

- 19:08 - 23:15 (4 mins): Modern machinery is great for profit! Farm as factory. Suitcase farmers. Government claims we could never use up the soil!
    
    - *And what follows all of this? An epic multi-year drought*

- 32:49 - 36:11 (4 mins): Jump ahead to preview the dust storms
