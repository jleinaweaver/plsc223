Painting: *Valley of the Yosemite* by Albert Bierstadt completed in 1864

- Bierstadt is one hell of a landscape artist!

- Let's use this to jump off into the sublime narrative

<br>

**Catch me up on our work from last class, how do the artists and writers we discussed in the sublime narrative view the wilderness?**

<br>

**And, from this perspective, when is the wilderness most valuable?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Applying the perspective

### From the sublime perspective, where is the SGF Conservation Nature Center on a scale from 0 (purely civilized) to 10 (purely wild)?

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 6, fig.height=1.25}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Purely\nCivilized", "Purely\nWild")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.9, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow(ends = "both"))
```

::: notes

**What is your rating of the SGF Conservation Nature Center if you adopt the sublime perspective on wilderness?**

- (The Edenic narrative sees the Center as a wilder place)

- (The sublime narrative sees a Lowes garden center)

    - A nature completely dominated by our hand
    
    - A nature made completely "safe"

<br>

**From the sublime perspective, is the Springfield Conservation Nature Center a good use of wilderness? Why or why not?**

- (Maybe. It is better than nothing)

- (BUT, this ain't the wilderness and visiting it will not do for us what these writers believed we need to have happen to open our minds, hearts and souls)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's take this perspective into the real world using the cases you found for today!

Your assignment for today was to find us examples of this Edenic narrative in the world around us

1. Arguments for Consumers: Find a product or service

2. Arguments for Citizens: Find an argument or call to action

<br>

*Split class into four groups*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start by talking about our lives as consumers!

<br>

Canvas DISCUSSION: Reflecting on the Sublime Narratives Around Us 

Find us two examples of this week's perspective, whether implicitly suggested or explicitly stated, being deployed in our community today (e.g. local, state, national or global). No overlapping cases (first-come, first-served).

1. Arguments for Consumers: Find a product, service or experience for sale that is designed to help us enjoy the wilderness or nature in its most "pristine" condition. Submit: 1) A web link to the product/service/experience, and 2) An explanation of HOW the marketing for this item connects it to the sublime narratives we explored last class (3+ sentences).

2. Arguments for Citizens: Find an example of someone arguing that we should preserve some specific piece of wilderness or nature in order to maximize its value. Submit: 1) A link to the argument, 2) a brief summary of the argument (2+ sentences), and 3) An explanation of HOW this argument connects it to the sublime narratives we explored last class (3+ sentences).

### Find a product, service or experience for sale that is designed to help us enjoy the wilderness or nature in its most "pristine" condition

::: {.fragment}
- How common is the sublime narrative in our consumer lives?
:::

::: notes

Groups, start by focusing on the consumer side of our lives (e.g. Canvas Assignment Q1)

- Take some time to review all the submitted cases and get ready to report back your experience of doing this assignment

- **REVEAL: Specifically, I want you to tell me, how common is the sublime narrative in the marketing of products and services to American consumers?**

<br>

*REPORT back and DISCUSS*

<br>

Let's take a second to compare the sublime-type marketing with the Edenic-type marketing.

- **Based on your lives as consumers in this society, which set of wilderness messages do you hear more often?**

- **In other words, do you see more sales pitches designed to help you exploit or celebrate the wilderness?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Review 2

### Find a product, service or experience for sale that is designed to help us enjoy the wilderness or nature in its most "pristine" condition

- Make two lists on the board: "Sincere" vs "Pure Marketing"

::: notes

Groups, evaluate the claims attached to each product or service and then make two lists on the board

- **Which products/services are "more authentically in line with sublime views of the wilderness" and which are "more transparent attempts to get your money"?**

- **In other words, which are walking the walk and which are just talking the talk?**

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**Which specific sublime marketing messages work best on you?**

- **Give me examples**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Jump to the political arguments

:::

<br>

### Find an example of someone arguing that we should preserve some specific piece of wilderness or nature in order to maximize its value

- What are the strongest reasons to preserve the wilderness?

::: notes

GROUPS, skim through ALL of the arguments and pull out what you think are the strongest reasons offered to protect any wild environment

- Build a list on the board!

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next class

<br>

### Utility Narratives of Wilderness

1. Read the excerpts from Pinchot, Spirn, and the USDA team

2. Submit your reflection on these ideas and how they apply to the world around us


::: notes

Next week we shift to our next historical perspective on wilderness

- These writers dramatically altered the course of the US in terms of our wildlife and wilderness management policies
