Last class we headed out into the world!

<br>

**Big picture, how did that go?**

- **Was that anyone's first time to the Nature Center?**

<br>

**Before we analyze it, just tell me, what were your impressions of it?**

- **Could you imagine yourself heading down there again on your own? Why or why not?**

<br>

Last week we also reflected on Roderick Frazier Nash's approach to defining the wilderness.

- **BEFORE we discuss the spectrum of environments tell me, according to Nash, what is the wilderness?**

<br>

The wilderness is a quality of something, not a thing to be identified

- The origins and exact meanings of the word across cultures has differed

- The meaning has also evolved over time

<br>

**SLIDE**: Therefore, Nash proposes a spectrum of environments

**A Spectrum of Environments (Nash 2014)**

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 6, fig.height=1.25}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Purely\nCivilized", "Purely\nWild")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 8) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.9, xend = 1.9, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow(ends = "both"))
```

::: notes

Per Nash, we may classify any environment on a scale from "purely civilized" to "purely wild"

<br>

**How does Nash define "purely civilized"?**

- (meaning the highest levels of human interference or shaping of the environment)

<br>

**And how does Nash present the "purely wild"?**

- (meaning the absence of human influence on the environment)

<br>

Ultimately for Nash, based on his extensive review of the history, wilderness tends to describe the absence of human control over an environment

- That quality can exist ANYWHERE and to ANYTHING

- It is not a fixed concept or a concrete item like a mountain or a stream

- And, importantly, it means we, as good stewards of our environment, can foster a little wilderness wherever we go

<br>

Alright, use our Nash material to reflect on our field trip experience

<br>

*Split class into four groups (5 per)*

- Spread out in the room and claim space on the board to work

- **SLIDE**

### On a scale of 0 (purely civilized) to 10 (purely wild), where would you rate the Springfield Conservation Nature Center?

![](Images/03_1-Nature_Center2.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Groups, start by discussing what each of you submitted to Canvas today for Q1

- Your aim is to find a consensus in your group, e.g. a single score for the Nature Center

<br>

IMPORTANT, don't write your score on the board!

- That score is the conclusion of your argument

- Instead make a list of the premises on the board that support your conclusion

- So, each group should have a list of reasons on the board that collectively explain the score you've decided on.

- **Make sense?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

*After each group presents their arguments, give the groups time to predict the scores for each one*

- *Report back and discuss*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Humor me for a second...

**Paper 1: The Importance of Wilderness**
:::

<br>

Make an argument that the wilderness is important to our community

- Due next Friday (Sep 5th)

::: notes

Don't forget, your five paragraph argument paper is due Friday

- This prompt, with a few more details, is on Canvas in the Assignments section

<br>

Important: This is an argument NOT an op-ed or opinion piece

- Arguments are built on logic and evidence, not feelings!

<br>

**Any questions on the assignment?**

<br>

**Does everybody have a clear thesis statement in mind?**

<br>

**Does everybody have their three premises picked out?**

- Make sure that each body paragraph has a clear topic sentence, explains the premise well and supports it with multiple pieces of evidence!

<br>

**Have you started collecting the evidence you need for each premise?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, let's move forward into Section 2 of the class

## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

**Section 2: Historical Perspectives on Wilderness**

- Edenic Narratives

- Sublime Narratives

- Utility Narratives

- Holistic Narratives

:::

::: notes

In this section of the course we are going to explore the historical roots that underpin all modern debates about the environment

- This will give us a chance to dig into some really important writings across time in order to consider the roots of our modern debates

<br>

My plan is that each week of this section we spend one day on readings and one day connecting those ideas to the real-world in direct ways.

<br>

And listen, there are so many great readings options out there for each of these views

- It was REALLY hard to narrow down to just a few for us each week

- If you ever want more just let me know and I can happily point you in some good directions!

<br>

**SLIDE**: This week we explore the Edenic narratives of wilderness

:::



## {background-image="Images/03_1-Garden_Eden.jpg" .center}

::: notes

**Anybody recognize this famous painting?**

- (*The Garden of Eden with the Fall of Man* or sometimes referred to as *The Earthly Paradise with the Fall of Adam and Eve*)

- Painted around 1615

- Peter Paul Rubens painted the figures and Jan Brueghel the Elder painted the flora and fauna

- Currently on display in an art museum in The Netherlands

<br>

**Ok, catch me up, what is the Garden of Eden and what happened there?**

<br>

The painting depicts the moment just before the consumption of forbidden fruit and the fall of man.

- God made Eden which was perfect

- Adam and Eve sin when they eat from the tree of knowledge

- God expels them from Eden into the wilderness and away from his protection

- In short, the Edenic narrative begins by framing wilderness as a place without god where we must struggle to survive

<br>

According to Bradford's 17th century diary and Wernick's (1965) argument this tells us all we need to know about how best to use the wilderness

<br>

According to White (1967), the dominance of this narrative has badly screwed up our relationship with nature to this very day!

<br>

I think the Bible message and the Bradford diary entries are pretty clear on this

- **SLIDE**: So, let's start by digging into the Wernick argument.

:::



## Wernick (1965) {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### Therefore, we should take full advantage of the resources available in the wilderness

- tl;dr we should spoil the wilderness!

::: notes

Here is the conclusion of Wernick's argument.

- Before we can dig into it, we need to identify what it actually says!

- GROUPS, diagram Wernick's argument for us

- Key premises on the board while you work!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: My version...

<br>

**My Wernick (1965) Notes**

- Asks the question, why shouldn't we spoil the wilderness?
- Defines wilderness as: "...the dark, the formless, the terrible, the old chaos which our fathers pushed back, which surrounds us yet, which will engulf us all in the end. It is held at bay by constant vigilance, and when the vigilance slackens it swoops down for a melodramatic revenge... It lurks in our own hearts, where it breeds wars and oppressions and crimes. Spoil it! Don't you wish we could?" (12)
- Very dismissive of the "propagandists" talking "about unspoiled wilderness" which he claims they mean to be merely a "kind of grandiose picnic ground, in the Temperate Zone, where the going is rough enough to be challenging but not literally murderous..."
- Argues that these desires are no more "legitimate" than the people who want to "build roads, dig mines, plow up virgin land, erect cities"
- The obstacle to "[rationality]" per Wernick is the propagandists "wrapping all its discourse in a vile metaphysical fog"
- Straw man 1? Wilderness defenders arguing we must protect the Bald Eagle because it is one of "god's beautiful creatures" but they have no qualms squashing a mosquito
- Straw man 2? Wilderness defenders justification "balance of nature" but the status quo is always changing. "Mother Nature" in her "bloody, blundering way" has been "lurching along for millions of years, wiping out whole species, drowning whole continents, burning, ravaging, destroying. Our rifles and DDT are puny compared to [these] forces".
- Argument: "The most we can do... is to look after our own interests as best we can, and no more consider the feelings of the eagle and the rhinoceros than they consider ours."
- Conservationists make mistakes. Saved the beaver in Montana and the forest destruction led to flooding
- The one "legitimate" reason to save wilderness is that "some people enjoy it and feel thrilled and enobled by it." BUT, this is a "minority taste"!
- "Wilderness lovers are a phenomenon of modern time; they are not tolerated in primitive cultures; the Bible doesn't have a good word to say for Ishmael. They breed in highly developed civilizations, where men have become bored with excessive cultivation and refinement. ... Underneath, they are decadents, aristocrats, snobs."
- Wernick claims to have no problem with this form of snobbery, but that these wilderness snobs are also megalomaniacs! Not satisfied with saving one mountainside or forest, wants hundreds of miles of them! 
- Straw man 3: Wilderness snobs feel a protected area is ruined if even one tiny mark of humanity can be seen in it (a beer can, a rickety ranger station, etc). That they only see value in the completely pristine.
- If you really want pristine wilderness, go traveling in poorer places and leave us to develop California for the growing population that is here.

:::


## Wernick (1965) {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center .smaller}

- Wilderness represents an oppressive darkness constantly assaulting us and breeding war and oppression

- Wilderness "propagandists" are bored snobs who fight to preserve a mild version of wilderness, only seek to defend cuddly megafauna and seek to protect a "balance of nature" that has never existed

- Wilderness preservation is just one legitimate use of our resources no better than building roads, mining or erecting cities

- Wilderness preservation is a minority viewpoint

Therefore, we should take full advantage of the resources available in the wilderness

::: notes

**Did I leave anything important out?**

<br>

**Are you convinced by this argument? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Does anybody know what logical fallacy Wernick is implementing in the second premise?**

- (**SLIDE**: A straw man)

::: notes

"an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument" (Oxford Languages 2025).

- Think of a scare crow in a field

- Imposing and scary from a distance (to birds), but up close full of nothing but straw

<br>

**First of all, do you agree P2 is a straw man? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Second, is the argument stronger if we remove P2? Why or why not?**

<br>

I genuinely think it is

1. No longer unnecessarily antagonizes some readers (the goal of argument is to convince!)

2. It no longer sets out to defend a bunch of propositions that would require a ton of evidence and don't really help the cause

<br>

**Is there a version of P2 we could add that would do a similar job but without a straw man?**

- (Wilderness advocates tend to be difficult to negotiate with because they are often inconsistent in the environments they choose to care about and the uses they find acceptable)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's take this perspective back to our old friend, the Nature Center!

IMPORTANT NOTE!

- My aim here is NOT to condemn Christianity or lead you in an ad hominem type attack

- This reading makes a compelling argument that ties directly into the Edenic narratives and we need to explore it

- Does embracing an edenic narrative lead inevitably to ecological catastrophe?

<br>

**White (1967) Notes**

- This article is really compelling. Well written, sourced and intriguing. I'm very much looking forward to digging into it with a class!
- “All forms of life modify their contexts” (1203)
- “Ever since man became a numerous species he has affected his environment notably”; Examples ABOUND
- "The history of ecologic change is still so rudimentary that we know little about what really happened, or what the results were."
- "As we enter the last third of the 20th century, however, concern for the problem of ecologic backlash is mounting feverishly."
- "The emergence in widespread practice of the Baconian creed that scientific knowledge means technological power over nature can scarcely be dated before about 1850, save in the chemical industries, where it is anticipated in the 18th century. Its acceptance as a normal pattern of action may mark the greatest event in human history since the invention of agriculture, and perhaps in nonhuman terrestrial history as well."
- "The simplest solution to any suspect change is, of course, to stop it, or, better yet, to revert to a romanticized past" (1204)
- "The "wilderness area" mentality invariably advocates deep-freezing an ecology..."
- "Our ecologic crisis is the product of an emerging, entirely novel, democratic culture. The issue is whether a democratized world can survive its own implications. "
- "Since both our technological and our scientific movements got their start, acquired their character, and achieved world dominance in the Middle Ages, it would seem that we cannot understand their nature or their present impact upon ecology without examining fundamental medieval assumptions and developments" (1204-1205).
- "Human ecology is deeply conditioned by beliefs about our nature and destiny-that is, by religion. "
- "The victory of Christianity over paganism was the greatest psychic revolution in the history of our culture."
- "What did Christianity tell people about their relations with the environment?"
	- "Like Aristotle, the intellectuals of the ancient West denied that the visible world had had- a beginning. "
	- "In sharp contrast, Christianity inherited from Judaism not only a concept of time as nonrepetitive and linear but also a striking story of creation"
	- "God planned all of this explicitly for man's benefit and rule: no item in the physical creation had any purpose save to serve man's purposes. And, although man's body is made of clay, he is not simply part of nature: he is made in God's image."
- "Especially in its Western form, Christianity is the most anthropocentric religion the world has seen."
- In Antiquity every tree, every spring, every stream, every hill had its own genius loci, its guardian spirit. ... Before one cut a tree, mined a mountain, or dammed a brook, it was important to placate the spirit in charge of that particular situation, and to keep it placated. By destroying pagan animism, Christianity made it possible to exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of natural objects."
- "Man's effective monopoly on spirit in -this world was confirmed, and the old inhibitions to the exploitation of nature crumbled."
- "It is often hard for the historian to judge, when men explain why they are doing what they want to do, whether they are offering real reasons or merely culturally acceptable reasons. The consistency with which scientists during the long formative centuries of Western science said that the task and the reward of the scientist was "to think God's thoughts after him" leads one to believe that this was their real motivation. If so, then modern Western science was cast in a matrix of Christian theology" (1206)
- "But, as we now recognize, somewhat over a century ago science and technology-hitherto quite separate activities-joined to give mankind powers which, to judge by many of the ecologic effects, are out of control. If so, Christianity bears a huge burden of guilt."
- "The newly elected Governor of California, like myself a churchman but less troubled than I, spoke for the Christian tradition when he said (as is alleged), "when you've seen one redwood tree, you've seen them all." To a Christian a tree can be no more than a physical fact. The whole concept of the sacred grove is alien to Christianity and to the ethos of the West. For nearly 2 millennia Christian missionaries have been chopping down sacred groves, which are idolatrous because they assume spirit in nature."
- Article sets up Saint Francis as a counter-point to the dominant approach of Christianity towards nature (e.g. an "equality of all creatures") that failed to be adopted
- "Hence we shall continue to have a worsening ecologic crisis until we reject the Christian axiom that nature has no reason for existence save to serve man" (1207).
- "Both our present science and our present technology are so tinctured with orthodox Christian arrogance toward nature that no solution for our ecologic crisis can be expected from them alone. Since the roots of our trouble are so largely religious, the remedy must also be essentially religious, whether we call it that or not. We must rethink and refeel our nature and destiny."

:::



## White (1967) {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

- The roots of our "technological and scientific movements" began in the Middle Ages as Christianity came to displace paganism

- A Christian ethos spread the idea that God had created the world to serve man's purposes

- By removing beliefs rooted in pagan animism (spirits in the natural world), Christianity made it possible to exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of natural objects

- Writings by scientists during this period make clear that their viewpoints were clearly "cast in a matrix of Christian theology"

Therefore, the source of our current ecological crisis is the orthodox Christian arrogance towards nature

**Are you convinced by this argument? Why or why not?**

**Edenic Narratives**

1. Arguments for Consumers: Find a product or service

2. Arguments for Citizens: Find an argument or call to action


::: notes

Your assignment for next class is to take the big ideas from this narrative approach to wilderness into our world today

- In short, we want to gather products being sold today and arguments that are currently being employed that are built on the Edenic narrative we've been exploring 

- Edenic narrative: The value of the wilderness is maximized through use

- The details are on Canvas

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Canvas DISCUSSION: The Value of the Wilderness Is Maximized Through Productive Use

Find us two examples of this week's perspective, whether implicitly suggested or explicitly stated, being deployed in our community today (e.g. local, state, national or global). No overlapping cases (first-come, first-served).

1. Arguments for Consumers: Find a product, service or experience for sale that is designed to help us extract the most value from wilderness or nature. Submit: 1) A web link to the product/service/experience, and 2) An explanation of HOW the marketing for this item connects it to the Edenic narratives we explored last class (3+ sentences).

2. Arguments for Citizens: Find an example of someone arguing that we should "open up" or increase our use of a specific wilderness or natural area in order to extract more value from it. Submit: 1) A link to the argument, 2) a brief summary of the argument (2+ sentences), and 3) An explanation of HOW this argument connects it to the Edenic narratives we explored last class (3+ sentences).
