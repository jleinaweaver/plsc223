Next Thursday we will meet at Valley Water Mill Park which is the home of the Watershed Committee of the Ozarks

- It's only a ten minute or so drive northeast from campus

<br>

**Has anybody been up there yet to walk the trails or meet with the team to discuss the watershed?**

- They have a beautiful hiking trail in addition to all the great material on our local watershed

<br>

Once again, make sure to let me know if you have trouble arranging a ride to the site

- And I will offer EC to anybody who carpools!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, back to our work in Section 2 of the class

**Section 2: Historical Perspectives on Wilderness**

- Edenic Narratives

- Sublime Narratives

- Utility Narratives

- Holistic Narratives

:::

::: notes

Section 2 of our class has been an exploration of some of the dominant narratives in the history of the human relationship to the wilderness.

<br>

During our time together I've been trying to show you how these are more than just historical artifacts

- While I always enjoy reading Thoreau, Muir, Cronon and the rest, that really wasn't the point

<br>

These narratives underpin the environmental policy debates we are having in our community today

- **What kinds of arguments do you hear in the world around us that mirror the Edenic narrative?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## The Historical Perspectives Today {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}
- Wilderness is a resource meant to improve our lives through its productive use (*Edenic*)

- Wilderness is a holy place meant to be appreciated and kept wild (*Sublime*)

- Wilderness is a valuable resource that must be managed so we don't run out (*Utility*)

- Wilderness is NOT a resource, it is our community and we depend upon it to live (*Holistic*)

:::

::: notes

**What kinds of arguments do you hear in the world around us that mirror the sublime narrative?**

- (**REVEAL**: Wilderness is a holy place meant to be appreciated and kept wild)

<br>

**And the utility narrative?**

- (**REVEAL**: Wilderness is a valuable resource that must be managed so we don't run out)

<br>

**And the holistic narrative?**

- (**REVEAL**: Wilderness is NOT a resource, it is our community and we depend upon it to live)

<br>

The key here as you well know is that NONE of these are right or wrong

- They are value judgements and ALL of them can be made in ways that I suspect each of you would be convinced by

- Edenic also means using wilderness resources to relieve human suffering

- Sublime also means finding times to appreciate the grandeur of the natural world

- Utility also means trying to find balance

- Holistic also means striving to better understand our place in the biosphere

<br>

My argument to you has been that you will be a more effective problem-solver in our community IF you better understand:

1. Our current debates have long historical roots,

2. Our relationship to the environment has been evolving over time, 

3. Solving real-world problems means understanding how your stakeholders view the world

<br>

**Make sense?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's use your pre-class work as a way to examine where we are as a class at this point

:::


## For Today {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Which **ONE** of the four historical perspectives comes the closest to your personal view of wilderness and its value to society? 

Submit and explain **three reasons** for your selection and make sure to connect your reasons to the readings (e.g. provide **evidence** for your claims).

::: notes

What I'd like each of you to do is present us your pre-class argument

- Let's see where you guys are at this point. 

- e.g. your personal perspective, the reasons for it and the evidence to support them

- No right or wrong, just a statement of the assumptions that speak to you the most

<br>

*Seminar Style: Circle up the class, put away computers and let's all talk!*

- *Go around the circle, look for chances to discuss things*

<br>

*Reflections on the Exercise*

**Does everyone define their personal "good" in the same way?**

<br>

**Did any of the evidence or reasons given by your classmates hit you particularly hard? Something you hadn't thought about? Or something they phrased really well?**

<br>

**How serious is our selection bias problem in this class? By that I mean, did we hear arguments in favor of all four perspectives today? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Do all of these versions of the personal "good" add up to a shared understanding of the public good?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: I'd like us to take all this good work into a second paper

:::



## Paper 2 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Make an argument that **ONE** of the historical perspectives on wilderness is the "best" approach to managing the **resources and needs of our community** going forward

- Argument paper with three premises and high quality evidence

- Must include a strong counter-argument paragraph

::: notes

The assignment prompt is on Canvas now

- My expectations are essentially the same as the first paper

- You are going to write me a focused argument paper with three clear premises, a counter-argument paragraph before the end and high quality evidence

- Due Oct 10th

<br>

BIG NOTE HERE: This is a different formulation than the Canvas assignment for today

- For that pre-class assignment I wanted the test of "goodness" to be personal to you 

- For the paper I want the test to be your conception of the "resources and needs of our community"

- Could these be the same thing? Sure, but it's not a certainty!

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Let's get to work on this.

- **Everybody take five minutes to reflect on our work for today and to select the perspective they want to choose for this paper**

- Sit with what you wrote before class and what you heard from the class and see where that takes you.

<br>

**Ok, does everybody have their perspective chosen?**

- **Now, 10 minutes to brainstorm a list of reasons why you chose this perspective**

- Don't edit yourself, this is brainstorming! Just write!

- Make sure these are complete sentences!

<br>

Now, share your lists with others in class. 

- Which premises on other people's lists do you like the best?

- Go see a bunch of different lists!

<br>

**Does everybody have their list narrowed down to three or four?**

- **Last task, take some time to reflect on the OTHER arguments you just heard. Pick one as your counter-argument!**

- REMEMBER, a valuable counter must be a strong argument. Your paper only gets weaker if you attack a straw man. Make a compelling case for a different perspective and then address it. 

<br>

Ok, you now have a rough outline for the paper

- **Any questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Time remaining: Writing workshop
