Next Thursday we will meet at Valley Water Mill Park which is the home of the Watershed Committee of the Ozarks

- It's only a ten minute or so drive northeast from campus

<br>

**Has anybody been up there yet to walk the trails or meet with the team to discuss the watershed?**

- They have a beautiful hiking trail in addition to all the great material on our local watershed

<br>

Once again, make sure to let me know if you have trouble arranging a ride to the site

- And I will offer EC to anybody who carpools!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, back to our work in Section 2 of the class

**Section 2: Historical Perspectives on Wilderness**

- Edenic Narratives

- Sublime Narratives

- Utility Narratives

- Holistic Narratives

:::

::: notes

Section 2 of our class has been an exploration of some of the dominant narratives in the history of the human relationship to the wilderness.

<br>

During our time together I've been trying to show you how these are more than just historical artifacts

- While I always enjoy reading Thoreau, Muir, Cronon and the rest, that really wasn't the point

<br>

These narratives underpin the environmental policy debates we are having in our community today

<br>

**Refresh my memory, per the Edenic perspective, what is the value of the wilderness? What is its purpose?**

- (**SLIDE**)

## The Historical Perspectives Today {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}
- Wilderness is a resource we use to improve our lives and relieve human suffering (*Edenic Narrative*)

- Wilderness is a special place that connects us to the grandeur of the natural world (*Sublime Narrative*)

- Wilderness is a resource to improve lives but must be managed so we don't run out (*Utility*)

- Wilderness is NOT a resource, it is our community and we depend upon it to live (*Holistic*)
:::

::: notes

**Per the Sublime perspective, what is the value of the wilderness? What is its purpose?**

- (**REVEAL**)

<br>

**Per the Utility perspective, what is the value of the wilderness? What is its purpose?**

- (**REVEAL**)

<br>

**Per the Utility perspective, what is the value of the wilderness? What is its purpose?**

- (**REVEAL**)

<br>

My argument to you this semester has been that you will be a more effective problem-solver in our community IF you better understand:

1. Our current debates have long historical roots,

2. Our relationship to the environment has been evolving over time, and

3. Solving real-world problems means understanding how your stakeholders view the world

<br>

**Make sense?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's use your pre-class work as a way to examine where we are as a class at this point

:::


## For Today {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Which **ONE** of the four historical perspectives comes the closest to your personal view of wilderness and its value to society? 

Submit and explain **three reasons** for your selection and make sure to connect your reasons to the readings (e.g. provide **evidence** for your claims).

::: notes

What I'd like each of you to do is present us your pre-class argument

- Let's see where you guys are at this point. 

- e.g. your personal perspective, the reasons for it and the evidence to support them

- No right or wrong, just a statement of the assumptions that speak to you the most

<br>

*Seminar Style: Circle up the class, put away computers and let's all talk!*

- *Go around the circle, look for chances to discuss things such as:*

- **Do these premises all point clearly to this single thesis? e.g. some of these premises look like they belong to the other perspectives, no?**

- **Can you choose the holistic perspective but omit Naess and Deep Ecology for its scarier conclusions? In other words, Leopold's "Land Ethic" sounds less scary, but doesn't it lead to the same places?**

- **Can you blend together assumptions from across the perspectives into a single view of wilderness? Why or why not?**

<br>

*Reflections on the Exercise*

**Does everyone define their personal "good" in the same way?**

<br>

**Did any of the evidence or reasons given by your classmates hit you particularly hard? Something you hadn't thought about? Or something they phrased really well?**

<br>

**How serious is our selection bias problem in this class? By that I mean, did we hear arguments in favor of all four perspectives today? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Do all of these versions of the personal "good" add up to a shared understanding of the public good?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: I'd like us to take all this good work into a second paper

:::



## Paper 2 {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

Make an argument that **ONE** of the historical perspectives on wilderness is the "best" approach to managing the **resources and needs of our community** going forward

- Argument paper with three premises and high quality evidence

- Must include a strong counter-argument paragraph

::: notes

The assignment prompt is on Canvas now

- My expectations are essentially the same as the first paper

- You are going to write me a focused argument paper with three clear premises, a counter-argument paragraph before the end and high quality evidence

- Due Oct 10th

<br>

BIG NOTE HERE: This is a different formulation than the Canvas assignment for today

- For that pre-class assignment I wanted the test of "goodness" to be personal to you 

- For the paper I want the test to be your conception of the "resources and needs of our community"

<br>

As an entry to the assignment and to clarify the prompt, I want you each to do some brainstorming for me

- **Who or what do you think of when I ask you about the "community" you live in? Your family? Your friends? Your church? The city of SGF? The ecosystem you live in?**

- No wrong answers here, everyone will almost certainly define the community in this paper differently

- Write down the community you are thinking of and which perspective you believe best provides for their needs and well being.

- Go!

<br>

**Has everybody defined their community and chosen their perspective?**

- **Now, brainstorm a list of reasons why you chose this perspective**

- Don't edit yourself, this is brainstorming! Just write!

- Make sure these are complete sentences!

<br>

Now, share your lists with others in class. 

- Which premises on other people's lists do you like the best?

- Go see a bunch of different lists!

<br>

**Does everybody have their list narrowed down to three or four?**

- **Last task, take some time to reflect on the OTHER arguments you just heard. Pick one as your counter-argument!**

- REMEMBER, a valuable counter must be a strong argument. Your paper only gets weaker if you attack a straw man. Make a compelling case for a different perspective and then address it. 

<br>

Ok, you now have a rough outline for the paper

- **Any questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Time remaining: Writing workshop
