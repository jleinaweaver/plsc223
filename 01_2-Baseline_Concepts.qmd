Next Thursday our first field trip of the semester

- We're meeting at the Springfield Conservation Nature Center

- We'll gather there at 9:35a and spend an hour (time to travel back to campus)

<br>

**Does everybody have a car?**

- **Anybody willing to car pool?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today we use our backyard to define the key concept: "nature"

::: notes

For today I asked each of you to explore our campus and submit photo evidence of your findings

<br>

**How did this go?**

- **Was this a simple enough task or not? Why?**

<br>

*Split class into small groups (4 each?)*

- *PUBLISH: Pure nature document on Canvas*

- Go sit with your group

<br>

On the Canvas Modules page I have added a document link that includes all of the class submissions to the first prompt.

- Open it up!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Prompt 1

<br>

Canvas Assignment: Reflecting on our Backyard

1. Take a photo of something on Drury's campus that you believe represents the wilderness or nature in its purest form. Include the photo and 2+ sentences explaining your selection.

2. Take a photo of something on campus that represents wilderness or nature in a slightly lesser form (e.g. still natural, but being managed or controlled). Include the photo and 2+ sentences explaining your selection.

3. Take a photo of something on campus that is clearly NOT an example of the wilderness or nature in any form. Include the photo and 2+ sentences explaining your selection.

**"Wilderness" / "nature" in its "purest" form**

1. Review the cases, and

2. Make a list of shared qualities
:::

::: notes

1. Groups review and discuss the submissions, and 

2. Develop a list of the qualities you argue are common to all of these examples (or most of them)

<br>

Let's build a big list of qualities of "pure" nature!

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Definition time

**Define "wilderness" / "nature" in "purest" form**

- Aim for one complete sentence
:::

::: notes

Ok, groups, if these are the qualities we are interested in I want you to write me a concise definition of the concept

- Aim for one complete sentence

- Go!

<br>

PRESENT and DISCUSS each

<br>

*PUBLISH the "not nature" cases*

- Ok, switch to the document I posted focused on your third cases (e.g. the examples of things that are NOT nature)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next prompt

Let's once again build a big list of qualities

- Groups, review the cases and make a list of shared qualities

**The Wilderness / Nature Scale**

- Ten point scale

- 1 ("Not Nature") to 10 ("Pure Nature")
:::

::: notes

Imagine a 10 point scale bounded by these two definitions (e.g. scale from not nature to pure nature)

<br>

Everybody open our final shared document that holds all our in-between cases

- Let's step through the cases

- Groups, you tell us where you would put this example on your version of the ten point scale and why

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: In sum

**What is "the environment"?**

- e.g. "nature" or "wilderness"

**Ok, where do we end up?**

- **What is "nature" or the "wilderness"?**

- **Do we have one single definition or a few competing ones?**

Canvas DISCUSSION: Share a Wilderness Experience
What is a meaningful experience you have had in the "wilderness" or in "nature"? Describe the experience and what made it meaningful to you. Also, share a picture of the place so we can see some version of what you saw during the experience (personal or just from the internet).
