3. Save 15-20 minutes at end for the documentary (12 mins) and discussion about our optimism / pessimism for the future of the plains

<br>

Today we continue our work in Section 3 of the class

- Last week we wrapped up our work on environmental justice issues

- **SLIDE**: This week we are kicking off our work on capitalism

**Refresh my memory, what are we talking about when we say we live under a capitalist system?**

<br>

By capitalism we typically mean an economic system based on:

- Private ownership of the means of production (not public), 
    
- Individuals motivated by the pursuit of profit, and 
    
- Free markets where prices are set by supply and demand

<br>

**SLIDE**: What's the harm?

**And from our early discussions last class, why might capitalism be harmful to the environment?**

- **Canvas last class: Any specific decisions you make as consumers that are problematic?**

<br>

**If you know these choices are harmful, why do you do it?**

- Is it because of capitalism? :)

<br>

As a framing exercise for this section of the class I want us to dig into an American environmental catastrophe

- **SLIDE**: The Dust Bowl

Let's set up our case study again

- PLAY DOCUMENTARY EPISODE 2, 0:00 - 7:00 (7 mins) to set up the whole thing

<br>

**SIDE**: Let's make sure we're clear on the scale of the ecological catastrophe

:::



## {background-image="Images/11_2-scimyst_dustbowl.webp" .center}

::: notes

The Dust Bowl is a perfect storm of misery

- Happens during the great depression so the economics of the time were already awful

- It goes way longer than many realized (10+ years)

- That 10 years was marked by serious drought conditions, excessive heat and frequent dust storms

- The dust storms blew at 60+ miles per hour and lasted anywhere from 1 hour to 3.5 days in length

- The dust was carried all the way to Boston and was reported by ships 300 miles into the Atlantic ocean

<br>

I find the scale of this ecological disaster hard to grasp.

- Dust storms so massive and disruptive as to drive dust particles across the continent and way out to sea.

<br>

**SLIDE**: For today we need to examine why this happened and whether it is likely to happen again!

## Worster's (1979) Argument {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Chapter 3

- Chapter 5

- Chapter 14

**Therefore, capitalism caused the Dust Bowl**

:::

::: notes

For class today each of you read and analyzed these three chapters

- I asked you to think of them like premises in this bigger argument

- **How did that go?**

<br>

*Split class into small groups (groups of 4?)*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start with chapter 3

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Chapter 3 (p44-63)**

1. What is the premise in this chapter?

2. What key evidence is provided?
:::

::: notes

Groups share your Canvas submissions on Chapter 3 and get ready to report back the premise AND the specific evidence provided to support this idea

- Go!

<br>

Let's get your ideas for the premise on the board

- *ON BOARD and DISCUSS*

<br>

**SLIDE**: I think there are three broad ideas here we should connect

:::



## Chapter 3: Key Ideas {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

- Capitalism weakens our national identity

- Capitalism implies individuality (e.g. bad times are your fault and your problem)

- Capitalism causes economic stresses which minimizes human empathy

::: notes

Personally, I've always been struck by Steinbeck's idea on p63: "...the ultimate explanation of the Dust Bowl: the alienation of man from the land, its commercialization, and its consequent abuse"

<br>

**Ok groups, what key pieces of evidence are provided in Chapter 3 to establish and support these ideas?**

- *Each group present one piece and evaluate it for us*

<br>

*A few notes to hit*

**On p62, what did Steinbeck mean by the sentence "the land bore under iron, and under iron gradually died"?**

- **What was the impact of the spread of tractors on poor farmers?**

(Surprisingly, or not, a bad one (p57).)

- Industrialized farming forced many poor families out.
- They couldn't compete on cost or size of production.

<br>

**Who were the "Okies" and how were they treated by other Americans?**

- (p45: outward bound refugees, p51: Dust Bowl refugees)
- (Treated very badly, p53 seen as biologically inferior men)

<br>

**Are we persuaded by these critiques of capitalism? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Do we believe that Americans today forced to leave their homes due to a natural disaster would be treated similarly?** 

<br>

**SLIDE**: Chapter 5

**Chapter 5 (p80-98)**

1. What is the premise in this chapter?

2. What key evidence is provided?

- Go!

<br>

Let's get your ideas for the premise on the board

- *ON BOARD and DISCUSS*

<br>

**SLIDE**: I think there are four broad ideas here we should connect emphasized on p94-97

:::



## Chapter 5: Key Ideas {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

- American culture defined by capitalistic ethos.

- Capitalism attaches us to cash, not the earth.

- Capitalism teaches us our survival is separate from nature's survival (autonomy and indifference).

- Capitalism views all resources commercially and imperially.

::: notes

Groups, get ready to talk through these with me based on the evidence in the chapter AND your experience of the world:

1. Is this an accurate critique of capitalism?

2. Is this an accurate description of America today?

<br>

*DISCUSS*

<br>

*Notes to Hit*

**According to Worster in chapter 5, what specific effects did introducing "machines" onto the plains have?**

- **e.g. tractors, plows, threshers and the combine**

- Do the work of 10-20 men without having to deal with those seasonal harvest laborers
    
    - p88 land entries skyrocket

    - p90 Labor needs fall AND acreage planted jumps!

    - p91 transforms you from clod to operator! From dumb brute to mechanic!
    
<br>

**Who were the "suitcase farmers"? (p93)**

- Machines made it easier to farm, this encouraged more people to do it. 

- Part-time farmers: Come in from town for planting and then leave until harvest time in the hopes something good grows.

<br>

**How does Worster use these "suitcase farmers" to make his argument?**

- (Capitalism + Technology = Suitcase farmers)

- (Suitcase farmers never develop a meaningful connection to the land.)

- (No connection to land -> abuse -> catastrophe)

<br>

In short, why does Worster argue the sodbusters failed where the indians succeeded?

- (Sodbusters focused on farming to maximize resource extraction from the land.)

- Early attempts failed when subjected to dust storms and long droughts.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last one, chapter 14

**Chapter 14 (p210-230)**

1. What is the premise in this chapter?

2. What key evidence is provided?

Groups share your Canvas submissions on Chapter 14 and get ready to report back the premise AND the specific evidence provided to support this idea

<br>

Let's get your ideas for the premise on the board

- *ON BOARD and DISCUSS*

<br>

**SLIDE**: The key ideas

:::



## Chapter 14: Key Ideas {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Capitalism shortens individual time horizons

- Capitalism creates incentives to ignore science
:::

::: notes

Groups, get ready to talk through these with me based on the evidence in the chapter AND your experience of the world:

1. Is this an accurate critique of capitalism?

2. Is this an accurate description of America today?

<br>

*DISCUSS*

<br>

**SLIDE**: The big argument

:::




## Worster's (1979) Argument {background-image="Images/background-forest_v3.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

- American culture is capitalist

- Capitalism replaces our national identity with one focused on being an isolated, economically stressed individual (consumer)

- Capitalism teaches us that nature is a resource and our survival is separate from nature's survival

- Capitalism shortens time horizons and creates incentives to ignore science

**Therefore, capitalism caused the Dust Bowl**

::: notes

**Ok, where do you end up with this?**

- **Are you convinced? Why or why not?**

<br>

Let's give Ken Burns a chance to weigh in on this again

- **PLAY Episode 2, documentary clip (12 mins) 1:34:29 - 1:46:41**

<br>

**Bottom line, are we doomed by our system to keep repeating this insane process? Why or why not?**
